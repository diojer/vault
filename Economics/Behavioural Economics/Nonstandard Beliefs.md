- Why do people maintain systematically incorrect beliefs

Three reasons
1. Probability estimation,
2. Self-evaluation bias,
3. Projection bias.

Deviations from Bayesian updating:
1. Availability heuristic:
	- People are bad at estimating probabilities of very rare events (e.g., lottery, plane crash, earthquake).
	- The availability heuristic is: people believe an event is more frequent if examples of it are easier to remember.
2. Representativeness heuristic:
	- Essentially the use of stereotypes.
	- The tendency to evaluate the likelihood that a subject belongs to a certain category based on the degree to which the subject resembles a typical item.

Biased interpretations of information:
1. Confirmatory/Confirmation bias
	- The tendency to interpret, process and recall new information as being consistent with one's prior beliefs and opinions.
	- Self attribution bias is related.
		- The tendency to discount information that is inconsistent with one's prior beliefs.
	- Example: death penalty in the US
		- Subjects were asked to read two reports on the deterrence effect of the death penalty.
		- Then, they were asked to say whether the report provided support for or against the death penalty.
		- Subjects' prior beliefs about the death penalty were collected a few weeks prior.
2. Projection bias
	- Related to forecasts of our behaviour in the future.
	- Individuals expect their future preferences to be too close to their present ones.
	- Leeuwen (1998):
		- They asked office workers to choose between a healthy or unhealthy snack to be delivered a week later.
		- Workers were asked to make the choice either when they were hungry or satiated.
		- The hungry group chose the unhealthy snack (78%) and the satiated group chose the healthy snack (42%).
	- Modelling projection bias:
		- $u^* (c,s)=(1-\alpha)u(c,s)+\alpha u(c,s')$
			- Where:
				- $s$ = current state,
				- $s'$ = future state,
				- $c$ = consumption,
				- $\alpha \in[0,1] \to$ measures projection bias, 1 is full projection bias and 0 is zero.
			- Essentially, the equation measures how much an individual thinks their utility will stay the same across time. When $\alpha=0$, we have the standard model.
		- Empirically, $\alpha \approx0.5$.

Framing:
- Kahneman and Tversky (1981) experiment:
	- Out of 600, would you rather save 200, or let 400 die?
	- Framing matters - people attach more utility to saving than "letting die".

Menu effects
- Choices out of a large menu set can lead to information overload.
- Individuals make decisions based on suboptimal heuristics:
	- Preference for the familiar,
	- Preference for the salient (things that stand out),
	- Choice avoidance.
- Empirical evidence: Weijers et al. (2024).
- Financial investments are a good example of this.
