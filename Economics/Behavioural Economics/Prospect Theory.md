>Prospect theory introduces a *decision-weight* mechanism, which, in EUT is equal to the probability of an outcome, in Prospect Theory the decision-weight and probability are related but disjointed.
# Assumptions
1. Humans care about gains and loss,
2. Humans don't necessarily care about absolute numbers, but will instead see them relative to a reference point,
3. Humans don't respond to objective probabilities, but instead transform them into subjective probabilities with which to use as decision-weighting factors.
# Weighting Function

This tells us:
- We are very sensitive to change in extreme probabilities,
- We assign more weight than we *should* (optimally speaking) to low probabilities and less weight than we should to high probabilities.
# Value Function and Loss Aversion
![[Pasted image 20241016143948.png]]
- The steeper *loss* line represents **loss-aversion**.
- The same change in outcome, when seen as a gain, provides less absolute value than that same change seen as a loss.
- We retain the diminishing sensitivity to losses and gains seen in EUT.

## Value and Risk
>When we are confronted with gaining money, the diagram tells us we are risk *averse*. However, when confronted with losing money, we are *risk seeking*. This can be seen in an example, but also in the change of concavity of the value function.
- Example:
	- Gain: choose between: $(£50) \text{ or }(£100,0.5)$. Because we are risk averse, we go with the former.
	- Loss: choose between $(-£1000) \text{  or }(-£2000,0.5)$. Because we are risk seeking when losing, people tend to go with the former.
# Empirics
>In studying the loss aversion coefficient $\lambda$, the median is ~1.7 and the mean is ~2. This means we value losses twice as much as gains.
## In the housing market
- Owners are unwilling to sell their properties for less than they paid (this represents loss aversion and the existence of a reference point).
- Loss aversion is greater for properties owned by individuals than properties owned by institutional investors - their market experience mitigates loss aversion.
- Housing market thus deviates from a perfect asset market, since the purchase price of an asset shouldn't matter when *deciding* to sell (the expected future value should really matter).
## Plastic bag tax
- Giving people £0.05 *off their shopping when they brought a reusable bag* was far less effective (almost negligible) compared to taxing people an extra £0.05 when they used a plastic bag.
