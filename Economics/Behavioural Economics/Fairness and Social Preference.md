In the standard model, an individual is always maximising their expected utility. In other words, their motives are purely self-regarding. However, this is not generally true.

In the behavioural model, people tend to be more complex. Self-interest does not always dominate.

In the Haifa experiment (Gneezy & Rustichimi 2000) a fine was introduced for parents who arrived late to pick up their children.
- Because they began to see the relationship as transactional, more parents started showing up late $\to$ the cost had shifted from an ethical one to an economic one.

There are models which explain cooperation in the standard model.
- Tit-for-tat models,
- Altruism toward close family members.
However, these models cannot explain why there is cooperation among large groups and strangers, or cooperation in one-shot interactions.
# Social Preferences
An individuals utility can be modelled as:
$$
U_{i}=\pi_{i}+\sum\beta_{ij}\pi_{j}
$$
Where:
- $\beta_{ij}$ is the weight attached to $j$'s material payoff on $i$'s utility.
	- This depends on which model of social preference we are in, and how we specify this weight.
- $j=1,2,\dots,n$
	- $n$ is the number of other individuals the $i$th individual has a social preference (or distaste) for.

==Fairness== is an individual's belief on how costs and benefits of people's behaviour should be distributed.
==Reciprocity== models can help us understand others' beliefs and intentions.
# Games
## Dictator Game
>Good measure of the first player's sense of fairness, as they have the power to be as *fair* or *unfair* as they like.
>In the game, two players bargain anonymously to share a prize.
1. The proposer (dictator) offers a division of the prize,
2. The responder *always* accepts whatever is given to them

The evidence tells us that, on average, dictators transfer 28% of their initial endowment toward the responders.

We can also add punishers to the game.
The punisher is given an endowment less than the initial prize and can choose to spend it *to take money away from the dictator*. The recipient does not gain this money, instead the dictator will lose as much money as the punisher decides to lose themselves.
- This is also a good way of measuring the punisher's sense of fairness.
- Individuals typically overestimated how much the punishers would punish them for a given distribution.
## Ultimatum Game
>Two players bargain to share a prize (£10) between them.
1. Proposer offers a distribution,
2. Responder decided whether to accept or reject the offer,
3. If accepted, the prize is distributed accordingly,
4. If rejected, players receive nothing.

The mean offer in this case is about 40%. The mean rejection rate is 16%.
- Proposers offering <20% got rejected in most cases.

While the proposers' behaviour could arguably be consistent with the standard model, the puzzling thing is the responders' behaviour.
- In the standard model, rejecting the proposal would never make any sense.

There are some variants:
- Where the roles are randomly selected, low offers are less likely to be rejected.
- Where the roles are chosen via a quiz, there are more low offers, which are less likely to be rejected.
	- Both players may feel a sense of fairness in rewarding hard work, i.e., winning the quiz.

In small-scale societies, the results vary.
- Rejections are extremely rare in some groups.
- The large variations suggest that beliefs about fairness and reciprocity are affected by specific conditions, like social institutions or cultural fairness norms.

Students do not seem to be more prosocial than other groups.

Offers are generally not dependent on the size of the prize, according to Hoffman, McCabe and Smith (1999), playing with £10 vs. £100.
- According to Cameron (1995), as the size of the stake increase the closer the suggested distribution gets to 50/50.
