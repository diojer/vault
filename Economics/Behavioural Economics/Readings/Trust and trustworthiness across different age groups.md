- 662 participants from six different age groups,
- 8-yrs old to retired persons,
- Trust increases almost linearly from early childhood to early adulthood, but stays constant within age groups. 
# Intro
- Trust is necessary for a cohesive society,
- Lack of trust will increase transaction costs.
# Game Design
- Player A, the trustor, has an initial endowment $X>0$ and sends amount $x$ to player B, the trustee, where $0 \leq x\leq X$. Player B received $3x$ and can return any amount $y$, where $0\leq y\leq 3x$. The final payoff for A is $X-x+y$, and for B is $3x-y$.

Trust is defined as the willingness to transfer a positive amount to the other person in the hope that this person will reciprocate at her own cost. Colloquially, trust is defined as the deliberate willingness to make oneself vulnerable to the actions of another party.
- The return $y$ compared to the received amount $3x$ is considered as an indicator for a subject's trustworthiness.
	- Trust and trustworthiness are related: trust (from A) can only be rewarded in the presence of trustworthiness (from B). Trust itself may elicit trustworthiness.

Trustee behaviour can be well explained by the assumption of inequity aversion.
- Average payoffs are similar in each age group between trustors and trustees.

# Empirical Evidence-base
Harbaugh et al. (2003) did not find any relationship between age and trust.
This study extends the Harbaugh study by making it easier for children to participate, covering a larger age spectrum, and they are basing their study on two fully specified hypotheses.
## Limits of existing economic theory
Traditional theory predicts a Nash equilibrium of transferring nothing, since once the trustee receives the money there is zero incentive to repay the trustor. Newer theories however do not take age-dependent factors into account.
- In the field of developmental psychology, trust is seen as a property of prosocial behaviour which increases with cognitive development. Age is correlated with cognitive development which is why trust increases with age.
