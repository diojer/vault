The minimum compensation people are willing to accept (WTA) in return for giving up a good already possessed exceeds the amount they are willing to pay (WTP) to acquire the same good.
# Explanations for the effect
- Reference dependent preferences.
	- This is supported by the fact that, if it were a mistake, we would expect a reduction in the number of endowment effects.
# Equation
$$
\frac{1}{2}\frac{p_{A|A}}{p_{A|B}} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{p_{B|B}}{p_{B|A}}
$$
# Experimental Design
Chocolates and mugs were given to a group of students and children.
- Agents mark which one they want or do not want to mark with a sticker.
- Goods are scarce so totals remain the same.
# Results
Endowment effects do not change with age which suggests that they are not mistakes but instead supports reference dependent preferences.
