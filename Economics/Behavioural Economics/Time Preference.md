Discounted utility model accounts for impatience/discount rate $\rho$.
Discount factor $\delta=\frac{1}{1+\rho}$.
$\delta^t$ shrinks as time passes meaning that consumption in future periods provides less utility than consumption in sooner periods.
If $\rho=0.25$, we require $r=0.25$ where $r$ is the rate of interest to delay consumption until the next period. $\rho=r$ for consumption to remain constant across time.
- the DUM is ==time consistent==.

When no changes have occurred except the passage of time, but our decisions to consume change, we have time inconsistent preferences.
Dynamic inconsistency suggests that there will be a different in choice outcome between front-end delayed and non front-end delayed decisions.
- Would you rather receive £200 now or £300 2 months from now,
- Would you rather receive £200 in 2 months or £300 in 4 months.
Present bias means that some subjects may switch answer even though according to the DUM the two options should remain constant.
# Quasi-Hyperbolic Discounting
==People experience greater impatience in the short-run than the long-run==
- Time inconsistency: we change our mind when events move from the future to the present.
- There is not a constant discount rate: $\beta\delta^t \text{ if } t>0$
	- This means the discount factor between the present and the next period $\beta\delta^t$ is lower than the discount factor between any two consecutive periods $\delta^t$
## Naïve and Sophisticated
- The naïve hyperbolic discounter runs into a self-control problem in period 2 and changes their plans.
- The sophisticated hyperbolic discounter is aware of self-control problems as uses a commitment device to make them stick to initial plans.
