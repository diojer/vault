- Observations fall into control group "naturally", because of an exogenous event, rather than being randomly selected and assigned by the researcher.
- The researcher exploits differences in outcomes between a treatment group and a control group.
- The critical element is that the treatment status is beyond the researcher's control.
 Some drawbacks:
- Still need to make the case that subjects do not self-select into treatment or control groups
- Good for causal inference but still have to question whether the treatment and control groups are directly comparable, i.e., how good is the counterfactual.
	- Sometimes you can add control variables
- Still have to consider: do the treatment and control groups resemble the assignments a researcher would make?
# Different kinds of Natural Experiments
1. Before and after comparisons
2. Cross sectional comparisons
3. Both together (differences in differences)
## Before and After comparisons
- For example:
	- Atlanta Olympics
		- During the 17 days of the Olympics, Atlanta restricted cars in favour of public transport
			- Reported a 40% decline in asthma emergencies
		- Time before Olympics is the control, 17 days of the Olympics is the treatment group.
		- Potential problems
			- Perhaps asthma emergencies were already trending downward
			- People changed their behaviours in a lot of ways due to Olympics
	- Beijing Olympics
		- Babies born during the Olympics were 28 grams heavier than babies born before and immediately afterwards
## Cross Sectional Comparisons
- For example:
	- Dr John Snow cholera hypothesis: people thought it was airborne, he thought it was waterborne
		- Some parts of London were served by two different water companies
		- East and South districts were served by water supplies obtained from known polluted parts of the Thames River
			- People didn't self select into water companies
		- Rest of London received drinking water relatively uncontaminated by sewage
## Differences in differences
- Two before and after comparisons, one for treatment one for control
- Basic steps:
	- Identify treatment group which received an intervention and measure outcome in that treatment group before and after the intervention.
	- Identify a control group which doesn't receive the intervention but is otherwise very similar
