1. Flu vaccine found to decrease rates of COVID-19?
	1. Areas with larger flu-jab uptake might be more health conscious
	2. Areas with higher capabilities to output flu vaccines may have higher economic status
2. Taking vitamin D reduces rates of COVID-19?
	1. Sunnier countries were getting hit hard because of external reasons
3. Strong negative association between public debt and economic growth?
	1. Might be because economic growth diminishes public debt
4. 90% of students who study abroad have employment 12 months later, compared to 75% of people who do study abroad

		1. Omitted variable bias
		2. Survivorship bias

			2. Would this be enough to change significant number of people's behaviour?
		5. Fuel prices
			1. Same as above but stronger effect size
		6. Train strikes and congestion
	5. Designing a field experiment
		1. Ensure that working from home is randomly assigned, no self-selection
