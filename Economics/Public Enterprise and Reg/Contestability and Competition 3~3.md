# Different types of bidding
1. Price per unit
	- Tender is awarded to bidder offering the lowest unit price, which should theoretically be equal to their average cost.
2. Lump sum payment
	- Tender awarded to bidder offering to pay the most for the right to a license, e.g., the right to operate trains on a certain line. Regulation is needed because this does not prevent monopoly pricing.
3. Lowest lump sum subsidy
	- For a loss-making industry, tender is awarded to a firm who needs the lowest subsidy to be operational.
>Once the company wins the tender, it is incentivised to develop the market and maximise revenue (assuming they bear revenue risk) and bring down costs.
>>They also aim to maintain quality to be re-selected next time.
- This paints a good picture of franchising.
	- When competition *in* the market is not feasible, franchising seems to retain the scale and scope benefits while making $P=AC$.
	- The most efficient operator is chosen, often prices can be low without the need for regulation.
- However, there are certainly problems.
	- Uncompetitive bidding,
	- Contract misspecification,
	- What happens if a firm miscalculated and things go wrong?
	- Asset handover from incumbent to a new entrant.
# Uncompetitive Bidding
- When there are not enough bidders, there is danger of collusion.
- An incumbent may have an advantage due to asymmetrical information - they will know cost and demand functions - and may use this to deter bidders.
- And...
## The Winner's Curse
>The firm that wins the tender will be the firm that valued the underlying franchise the highest. However, assuming that the market will *on average* find the true underlying value, then assuming some level of variance a small number of firms will under- and overshoot the true value. The firm that overshoots by the highest will be the winner.
>>Consequently, if you win the tender, it is very likely you overestimated the underlying revenues and, due to the constraints you imposed on yourself with the contract, will not be able to fulfil your full-term obligations.
>>>Once the winner wins the contract, they will use this new information to revise down their own estimate of the value (knowing that all other firms bid lower than them).
- Sophisticated bidders may take this into account and bid below their own estimates of the true value.
	- So, if all bidders are truly rational, they will likely continue to revise down their estimates until the winner's estimate does align with the true value.
- When there is a mix of naÃ¯ve and sophisticated bidders, this can be a problem for the client (government).
	- It may seem good for the client, since the bidders are providing a service for a far lower cost than they would if they knew the true value of the underlying franchise.
	- However, if services begin to fail and quality drops to cut costs this reflects badly on the government. It is better to have a stable bidder rather than an unstable, temporarily cheaper, bidder who will not be able to carry out their contract to term.
### Empirical Examples
1. British Rail Franchises
	- Background:
		- Rail franchises in GB put out to tender 1995-1997.
		- There were 25 franchises to license - most were loss making so a subsidy was needed even after privatisation.
		- The objective being bid on was the ability to reduce the subsidy the fastest - the private sector promised to remove all subsidies within seven years.
		- Operators took on both the revenue and cost risk.
	- These promised cost-savings did not materialise - this is likely evidence of the winner's curse.
	- Outcomes:
		- Companies started to cut quality and needed bailouts.
		- The companies were moved onto cost + style contracts with higher subsidies.
		- It took time to re-tender the contracts which disrupted services.
2. East Coast Mainline Intercity Franchise
	- Background:
		- This line connects Inverness to London King's Cross, passing through Leeds.
		- It was won by GNER in 2005
	- GNER had to hand back the franchise - National Express bid in 2007.
		- National Express also handed back the franchise.
	- Virgin/Stagecoach then won the franchise, but again had to hand it back.
	- LNER now runs the line since 2018.
	- These three failures were broadly caused by aggressive revenue projections.
	- Outcomes:
		- The DfT no longer renegotiates contracts.
3. Refuse Collection
	- Background:
		- Classic example of successful tendering.
		- Councils were required in the mid-1980s to put out all contracts to competitive tender.
	- Outcomes:
		- Big cost reductions,
		- It was not statistically significant whether it was a private company doing the collection or not, just that there was competition for the tendering.
	- Why did it succeed?
		- There were no revenue risks, just cost risks.
		- It is a fairly simple service with little information asymmetries.
		- No sunk costs.
		- The is cost-free monitoring which doesn't allow for a drop in quality - residents complain if their bin collections are missed.
## Strategic Bidding
>Firms may purposefully overvalue the underlying franchise in order to win the contract, and then renegotiate the contract with the client (government) later.
# Final Considerations
1. Are the cost savings from tendering worth the contract administration?
2. What role does politics play? Is there a bias for higher quality and less concern over cost? Do political figures avoid tendering where it could help?
3. How easy is it to write the contract?
# Questions
- Do the tender-winners also have an incentive to find secondary markets which are not price regulated to attempt to cross-subsidise their price-controlled primary market?
	- E.g., food sold on trains could be very expensive, selling advertising space on trains, essentially charging monopoly prices on goods/services not specified in contract.
- Regarding probability theory of the winner's curse
	- Wouldn't you expect the normal curve to shift to the left until the winner's point aligns with the true valuation assuming sophisticated bidders?
		- It would then oscillate around this point.
