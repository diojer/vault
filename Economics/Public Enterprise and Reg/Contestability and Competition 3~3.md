Q:
- Do the tender-winners also have an incentive to find secondary markets which are not price regulated to attempt to cross-subsidise their price-controlled primary market?
	- E.g., food sold on trains could be very expensive, selling advertising space on trains, essentially charging monopoly prices on goods/services not specified in contract.
- Regarding probability theory of the winner's curse
	- Wouldn't you expect the normal curve to shift to the left until the winner's point aligns with the true valuation assuming sophisticated bidders?
		- It would then oscillate around this point.
