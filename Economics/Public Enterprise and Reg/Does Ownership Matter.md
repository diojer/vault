- Privatisation theoretically leads to more efficiency
	- Monitoring,
	- Single objective and a specific focus on efficiency,
	- Less surprise government intervention.
- However, its success depends on post-privatisation regulation.
	- Independent vs. gov regulator,
	- What kind of regulation, RPI-X or ROR?

Empirical Evidence
- Domberger and Piggott, 1986
	- Public firms have higher unit costs - panel data,
- Viscusi et al 2005 p. 516
	- Literature survey supports hypothesis that there is greater efficiency with private enterprise,

What is the importance of competition:
- Caves and Christensen 1980
	- Previous studies generally supported the view that the lack of incentives associated with public ownership resulted in poorer performance.
	- Most studies though looked at public firms in a non-competitive environment.
	- They compared Canadian National with Canadian Pacific in a competitive environment (railway operators).
	- When competition is introduced the gap between private and public companies is reduced greatly.
		- Competition seems to be more important than ownership.
- Adler and Liebert 2014
	- Investigated private regulated airlines,
	- Same conclusion as Caves and Christensen, competition reduced differences between public and private ownership.

What is the importance of regulation:
- Saal and Parker 2000
	- Investigated 10 regional water companies.
	- Found that regulation had a statistically significant, negative impact on costs when privatisation.
		- This suggests a regulatory framework is important for privatisation to succeed.
- Smith et al. 2018
	- Developed a multi-dimensional index for evaluating strong regulators.
	- Found that strong regulation reduces costs.
- Decker 2023
	- With a competent regulator, most regulation should be expected to achieve cost reductions.

Are reform to public enterprise preferable to privatisation?
- Bishop and Thompson 1992
	- Increases in productivity going from the 70s to the 80s was biggest in steel, coal, post office, rail - the most important aspects were more competition and a better regulatory framework.
- Littlechild and Skerk
	- Public enterprise will have too much intervention, short-termism, too little investment.

Complete and incomplete contracts:
- Problems with quality delivering - when quality cannot be exactly specified the contract is "incomplete".
- Alonso and Andrews 2014
	- Private prisons had better performance on easily measurable things, like "purposeful activity", but performed worse on drug use.
- State ownership might attract different kinds of people with an interest in service.
