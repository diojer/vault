# How do we introduce competition in natural monopolies?
>To introduce competition, we need to rethink the industry, separating the natural monopoly part - typically hard infrastructure or network management - from those parts of the industry which are not natural monopolies.

If we take:
1. The UK electricity industry,
	- Pre-privatisation, energy generation and the national grid were nationalised, with 12 nationalised area boards controlling distribution.
	- Now, essentially all factors have been privatised. The private grid, which was identified as a natural monopoly, is regulated. Other parts of the industry, such as generation and distribution, have been privatised such that various different companies compete on this front.
	- Has it worked:
		- There have been significant efficiency gains achieved and price reductions to users since 1990,
		- In recent years there are concerns over pricing and profit margins.
		- Some problems come down to people's reluctance to switch, which decreases competition.
			- Poorer households pay more (coin operated meters),
			- This led to a regulated price cap.
2. Telecoms
	- Infrastructure, i.e., phone lines, are managed mainly by BT with few exceptions. This makes infrastructure management a natural monopoly.
	- Companies pay a fee to operate on BT's phone lines and then provide telephone services to consumers, i.e., a two-way real-time voice transport service.
3. British Rail
	- Operating the railroad infrastructure in this case is a natural monopoly.
	- Companies pay a fee to use railroads, these can be Train Operating Companies (TOCs) or Freight Operating Companies (FOCs).
		- TOCs transport people. They compete "for the market", in that they are themselves monopolies - meaning they own the whole market share of a particular transport route - but compete amongst themselves for these contracts.
		- FOCs transport goods. They compete "in the market", which is what we understand as the typical definition of competition.
	- Rolling Stock Companies (ROSCOs) own the train and transport stock itself, such as the physical coaches, locomotives and freight wagons. They hire these out to TOCs or FOCs.
4. Postal Service
	- In this case, the Royal Mail Delivery Network is the natural monopoly. Although there are other delivery networks, a good way to conceptualise the natural monopoly is the post box. This is typically infrastructure which does not need to be duplicated.
	- In the past, Royal Mail used to make profit by offering bulk mailings to, e.g., banks for sending out bank statements.
		- Now, this upstream market has been privatised and Royal Mail has lost 64% of its market share.
		- It has retained the vast majority of the downstream market, i.e., the delivery market.
	- Before, the mailing profits used to cross-subsidise the delivery market. However, with privatisation, costs of deliveries must be paid for at the point-of-service, causing stamp prices to increase drastically.
# Profit Maximisation vs. The Social Optimum
Often, behaviour by firms to undercut competitors can result in "bunching", where services are provided at very close times or places.

1. The first line represents two ice-cream vendors at disequilibrium. There is an even distribution of customers along the red line. At the moment, A will acquire the majority of the market share.
2. B will "undercut" A by repositioning slightly to the left. A will do the same, and this continues until both bunch up at the centre, each now earning 50% of the market share from either side.
3. The socially optimal position, at the bottom, would still earn each 50% of the market share but would also save people at either end from needing to walk so far.
>This behaviour can explain timetable bunching in buses and trains when competition is introduced.

# The Threat of Competition: Contestability
>The Theory of Contestable markets was started by Baumol (1982).
>It can be applied where competition is not feasible or is undesirable, such as in a naturally monopolous industry.
- Where a market is contestable, the *threat* of competition can reduce the need for regulation.
In a contestable market, the position of monopolist is open to competitors, while the industry itself is not. The threat of entry can constrain the behaviour of the incumbent.
- Because there is only one firm, we retain the scope/scale benefits.
## Perfect Contestability
1. All firms have the same cost functions,
2. No barriers to entry or exit,
3. **Entry is faster than price adjustment**
This means that:
- Existing firms are subject to "hit and run" entry,
- Even a very small profit opportunity would be taken up by a potential entrant,
- Profits would never be higher than normal profits,
- Cost function would remain as low as possible,
In oligopoly situations, P=MC (does not apply to natural monopolies).
## Imperfect Contestability
>Are the assumptions realistic?
- Is assumption 3 ever reasonably met?
	- Maybe with secret contracts...
	- But commitments from incumbent not to undersell, e.g., "we'll refund any lower price" provides an instantaneous price adjustment.
- The assumption of zero sunk costs is very hard to meet where most natural monopolies exist, like in heavy infrastructure operation.
This all suggests that perfect contestability is very rare, or non-existent.
