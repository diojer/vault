# Abstract:
CTC tends to improve service quality and efficiency in healthcare services in Norway.
# Theoretical Framework
- CTC-support:
	- Public sector is less efficient and wastes resources,
		- Public choice theory indicates that competition for contracts helps to align bureaucrats' interests with citizens' values.
		- Property rights theory focuses more on capital markets and private ownership itself helping to align interests.
		- According to Domberger et al. (1995) and Bel and Warner (2008) a change from public to private ownership will only have a marginal effect without the presence of competition.
- Possible counterarguments
	- Principal-agent theory
		- It's possible that contracting with other parties will create additional agency problems that public managers now have to manage.
		- Private entrepreneurs are more likely to be opportunist than non-profits or public agencies.
	- Transaction-cost economics
		- CTC creates the need for the government to gain contract-management capacity. This is especially the case for services with low-measurability.
# Empirical Findings
## In pre-existing literature
CTC is strongly correlated with cost-savings.

Regarding quality, the findings are more mixed.
- This may be due to the fact that quality is harder to measure.
- Objective indicators do not have a clear relationship with the users' own experiences.

A study from Sweden found that nursing homes contracted out to private organisations are associated with a lower staffing rate but achieve higher score on quality indicators.
- Private contractor run homes are more associated with service-minded activities.

In Norway, an evaluation report found that privately contracted homes use a higher share of resources on user-directed activities than government-run homes.
	Pedersen, 1998
- Homes run by private contractors spend more money on care, less on administration, food and laundry.
	- Users reported satisfaction with food, although it was produced more efficiently.

Swedish evaluation reports also find that employees of private organisations score higher among users on how they treat users.
	Socialstyrelsen, 1996
- Specifically, private sector employees focus more on attention to secondary needs, like socialisation and activation.

==Municipal staff express a belief that without the contracting, the development of the tools to monitor quality would be considered too time-consuming to carry out.==
	Bogen, 2002
## In experiment
Dependent variables:
1. Nursing home
2. Living Facilities
3. Home nursing
4. Home help
(Each dependent variable was measured for citizen satisfaction and user satisfaction).
---
- CTC is a significantly significant, positive relationship with satisfaction in 7 of the 8 dependent variables modelled.
- When CTC is *recently introduced*, it has a negative relation with satisfaction. This indicates that the transaction-cost economics view has some merit - with more experience, government contract-management capacity improves and the relationship switches to positive.
	- This may also support the further principal-agent hypothesis that private enterprise is more opportunistic.
