Questions to consider:
1. Why was the windfall tax implemented and how does this relate to the regulatory and privatisation models adopted?
2. Who was affected and by how much? How was the tax calculated?
3. Does the need for a windfall tax imply that RPI-X regulation failed?
4. Was the government right to impose the windfall tax?
5. What were the alternatives?

# Introduction
It was estimated that the windfall tax would raise £5.2bn in two stages, from a group of over 30 privatised utility companies.
- It would be based on a measure of the increase in the value of the companies during their first four years in the private sector over their value at privatisation.
# Background
Since 1992 the Labour party had advocated for a one-off tax on private utility companies. This made it into their 1997 manifesto and was implemented in the newly elected government's first Finance Act.
- Utility companies were thought to have earned a windfall due to:
	- Under-pricing of shares during privatisation,
	- Under-regulation of companies in their initial years.
- The windfall tax was supposed to get back some of these benefits.
	- It was then meant to fund a welfare-to-work scheme.

Were companies sold off too cheaply?
- Many privatised companies experienced an increase in their share price in their first day of trading. In some cases, shares opened over 50% higher than the offer price.
- In the long-run, some utilities continued to perform well, others not so much.

Were the regulatory regimes too lax?
- The industry regulators' primary role was to ensure that all reasonable demands for the service could be met. The regulator also had a duty to promote competition in the industry. Where competition takes time to develop, they should protect customers through controlling price and quality of service.
	- The regulator should also promote social and national objectives, like ensuring that emergency services are provided and special services are provided for the disabled and elderly.
- The precise form of regulation can vary between different industries but are typically based on a system of price caps, which can set limits on the rate of change or sometimes set minimum price reductions.
	- Price caps were set at privatisation, to be reviewed regularly. They were designed to protect consumers but encourage efficiency gains.
		- As the period of review usually takes 5 years, unforeseen gains in efficiency give about 5 years worth of extra profit. These would be taken away at the next review period.
	- Part of the criticism then comes from the regulatory design in allowing companies to hold onto this profit.
- According to some, regulators had difficulty in obtaining accurate information from individual companies about their potential future efficiency gains - consequently, price caps were too lax.
	- This was the case in 1994 when the electricity price cap had to be prematurely tightened due to an upswing reaction by the stock market to the initial cap.

These regulatory failures (lax regulation and initial under-pricing) encapsulate the windfall tax arguments.
- If the initial price was closer to the real value, it would also have included future profits and thus the two problems are intimately related.
# Implementation
1. Scope
The tax applies to companies that were privatise by flotation and that face economic regulation. It therefore encompassed:
- 12 regional electricity companies (RECs) in England and Wales; 
- The 10 water and sewerage companies (WASCs) of England and Wales;
- The English electricity generators - National Power and PowerGen;
- The Scottish combined electricity generators and distributors - Scottish Power and Scottish Hydro-Electric;
- The company responsible for electricity transmission, distribution and supply in Northern Ireland - Northern Ireland Electricity;
- And British Energy, which owns part of the nuclear-powered generating capacity.
Also covered were:
- BAA (British Airports Authority),
- British Gas (now BG and Centrica after demerging in 1977),
- British Telecom (BT),
- Railtrack.

Companies not privatised by flotation were not covered by the tax, reflecting the fact that underpinning the tax was the under-priced shares. Companies not regulated also were not included, reflecting the fact that lax regulation was also being targeted.

2. Scale
The tax was expected to raise £5.2bn.

After the budget, share prices did react to the incoming tax.
- A windfall tax of about £5bn was discounted into the share price of utilities which fell in scope, i.e., the market value of the utilities was about £5bn less than it would've been were the tax not suggested.
	- However, these movements are difficult to disentangle from more general movements due to the rest of the budget.
	- Some saw shares rise as they were not expected to contribute so much to the tax.

3. Calculating the tax
The tax is the difference between a company's initial valuation and a more realistic valuation based on after-tax profits up to the first four years after privatisation.
$$
Tax=\tau(V_{p}-V_{f})
$$
- $\tau$, the tax rate, is 23%,
- $V_{f}$ is the value at flotation,
- $V_{p}$ is value calculated from profits.
$$
V_{f}=pNS
$$
Where:
- $p$ is the share price at flotation,
- $NS$ is the number of shares issued,

$$
V_{p}=\frac{1}{4}\left( \sum_{t=1}^4 \pi_{t} \right)\times pe
$$
Where:
- $\pi_{t}$ is the profit at time $t$,
- $pe$ is the price-earning ratio (set equal to 9 in all cases)
Essentially, this means $V_{p}$ is equal to the average profit across the 4 years multiplied by the price-earning ratio.

Some problems arose from:
- Definition of post-tax profits,
- The use of average profits to estimate valuation rather than actual market values,
- The use of single price-earnings ratio rather than more specific ratios.

Price-earnings ratios:
- The p/e ratio, set to 9 in all cases, is based on the lowest average p/e ratio calculated by sector for the relevant years.
	- Using the lowest has the effect of only grossing up the profits of all companies by the average p/e ratio for the water sector, which was 9.3 during those years.
		- Companies with a higher p/e benefited from this as their valuation is being estimated lower than it would be with more specific targeting.
- It would have been possible to use alternative ratios.
