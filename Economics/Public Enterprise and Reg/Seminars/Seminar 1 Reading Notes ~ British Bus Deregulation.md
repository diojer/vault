# Background
Prior to deregulation, entry into the British bus industry had been restricted by a licensing system.
- Single operator was given the right to run any particular route,
- Fares and timetables were controlled.

After deregulation, any operator who satisfied the basic safety standards and gave 42 days notice could offer whatever bus services they wished.
- Subsidised, socially necessary services were selected based on competitive tendering.
# Arguments for deregulation
1. Superiority of competition over monopoly - should lead to reduced fares and increased output.
2. Real costs had been steadily increasing, and a reduction of up to 30% due to increased productivity and lower wages was forecast.
3. Previous regime cross-subsidised unprofitable routes at unprofitable times - this apparently favoured wealthier rural/suburban dwellers and disadvantages poorer inner city dwellers.
4. The bus industry was arguably contestable - low sunk costs, low capital requirements, easy entry and exit.
# Arguments against deregulation
These generally rest upon the particular character of the bus industry.
- Service quality, i.e., frequency and timing of services, is determined collectively by the decisions of all operators on what timetable to run.
	- Those against deregulation thought it would be very hard to leave this kind of planning to the market.

It was also argued that, as passenger numbers and output increases, the quality of service increases, since service frequency and waiting times fall.
- This is analogous to a producer economy of scale, except that the benefits of reduced costs are felt by the consumer.

The distinction between the "first best" and "second best" worlds I find confusing.
- The producer economy of scale leads to "a universal case for subsidising scheduled transport services in a first best world".
- This is posited as better than the "second best argument for diverting traffic from the private car in cases where congestion and environmental externalities exceeded the tax paid on the car."
	- This only applies on congested roads, and the subsidy which it justifies it limited by the low cross-elasticity of car and bus travel.

If operators sought a Nash equilibrium, the result would be too high a service level at too high a price.
- Experience suggested that aggressive behaviour by either the entrant or incumbent was likely.
	- This includes schedule matching and excessive service provision.
# What Actually Happened
Real costs decreased, bus miles run increased.
However, real fares increased everywhere except Scotland, and passenger trips decreased (the opposite intended effect).

Due to 42 day window, incumbents could adjust prices down before entrants came in.
## London
In London deregulation was not pursued so vigorously, instead entry was regulated but the incumbent was decided via competitive tendering. Results were better, with the regulator retaining some control over fares and timetables, but costs still decreasing by 14%.
