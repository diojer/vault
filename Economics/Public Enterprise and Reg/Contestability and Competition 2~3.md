# Recap
- The theory of contestable markets argues we should deregulate entry into a market to increase the pressure of possible competition, which keeps prices low without regulation.
- However, in the case of a non-sustainable natural monopoly, i.e., [[Natural Monopoly and Competition#Do we need to regulate entry and prices?|where the monopoly finds itself on the tail-end of the AC curve]], firms are vulnerable to "cream-skimming", i.e., the undermining of their cross-subsidy and the efficient cost structure.
- This takes up back to the beginning - we need to regulate entry and therefore price.
- This can be summed up as:
	- Natural Monopoly
		- Contestable
			- Sustainable $\to$ deregulate entry, no price regulation necessary
			- Non-sustainable $\to$ regulate entry and prices
		- Not contestable
			- Sustainable $\to$ regulate prices, entry regulation not necessary
			- Non-sustainable $\to$ regulate entry and prices.

# Imperfect Contestability
- Entry is worthwhile in imperfect contestability if:
$$
\pi(P) \cdot T \geq S
$$
- Where:
	- $T$ is the number of price periods the entrant stays in the market,
	- $S$ is the level of sunk costs,
	- $P$ is the price set by the incumbent,
	- $\pi(P)$ is the profit made.
- Consequently:
	- The incumbent can deter entry if $\frac{S}{T}$ is greater than the profits made in one time period.
	- As the sunk costs increase, entry is discouraged,
	- As the time the entrants could potentially stay in the market increases, entry is encouraged.
- Perfect contestability is a *special case* where $S=0$. Incumbents cannot discourage entry if their profit is greater than 0.
## Relevance
- The theory of contestability caused economists to realise the importance of sunk costs as a source of monopoly power.
	- They impede exit, and consequently, entry.
- Raised awareness of potential as well as actual competition in affecting prices,
	- Also raised awareness of the fact that imperfectly competitive markets could still potentially produce efficient outcomes,
- Consideration of hit-and-run strategy as opposed to traditional ideas of competition.

# Competition For the Market
>This is also known as ex-ante competition
- Ex-ante competition involves competition to *win* a monopoly right to supply a particular market.
- The government invites bids from several competing firms to buy the right to provide services.
	- Once a winner is announced they run the service for a period of time set out in the contract.
	- After this time has passed, the service is re-competed for.
*This allows us to regulate entry but also introduces competition on, e.g., price*.
>This is different from contestability as there are barriers to entry, theoretically it is impossible to enter the market if you were not awarded the contract.
---
- This approach differs from privatisation, as an asset is typically not sold and the contract only lasts for a limited time period.
- Output and price is managed via a contract between gov. and firms,
	- As opposed to output and price being managed via regulation (as in privatisation).

>There are two types of competition for the market focused on in this course.
1. Franchising
	- Franchisee bears cost and revenue risk,
	- E.g., passenger rail franchises (length of 7-15 years),
	- E.g., McDonalds is a commercial franchise.
2. Competitive tendering
	- Similar to franchising,
	- Franchisee tends to bear no revenue risk, only cost risk.
---
>There are two types of auction:
1. Private Value Auction
	- Each bidder attaches their own private valuation to the good which depends on personal tastes and is independent of others' valuations.
2. Common Value Auction
	- The good is assumed to have the same value to all bidders, but their is uncertainty over its value.
	- E.g., oil drilling rights.
>For example, a Rail Franchise will have elements of both types of auction.
>>One group may have a different cost or revenue function, meaning there is a private value component.
>>On the other hand, there is a common value component: there is some uncertainty over the value of the franchise.
- Because the common value is uncertain, it makes the tendering process potentially less efficient - some firm may outbid others on the contract simply because they project the subsequent revenues as the highest.
	- This may be a company with a less efficient cost structure.
- On the other hand, if the common value is agreed upon, then the company with the most efficient cost function will likely win the bid, resulting in an efficient outcome.
