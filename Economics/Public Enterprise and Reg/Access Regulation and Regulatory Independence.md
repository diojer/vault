# Access Regulation
- How can regulators ensure fair access to infrastructure?
Example: European Commission sees competition as key to success of railways. There is complete vertical separation and thus an independent infrastructure company.

Access regulation is needed when there is a dominant incumbent rail or train operator.
- Holding company model (Deutsche Bahn is a big example)
	- Infrastructure and incumbent train operator are both part of a parental holding company. Full vertical separation would lose some coordination benefits.
	- British Gas has full legal vertical separation,
	- The question with the holding company model is if the infrastructure company will treat the incumbent favourably due to their shared parentage.
- Holding Company vs. Vertical Separation
	- There's a break even point, after which a higher level of train density will mean that vertical separation is more expensive than a holding company model.
# Regulatory Independence
Regulator should be independent of:
- Firms
	- Firms are driven to improve efficiency rather than seek rent,
	- Ensures consumers get the best deal.
- Government
	- Governments may interfere for political popularity,
	- Firms need to be sure they can get a fair return on investment,
		- Firms are vulnerable once they have made sunk-costs,
		- I.e., if companies don't have certainty they won't be forced to make sudden changes for political purposes, the risk will likely be too great to invest.

Regulators are appointed by government but then independent.
- Regulators are given "fairness criteria" and are required to act consistently.
- Primary legislation (Act of Parliament) is required to remove an independent economic regulator.
- Firms have ways to appeal decisions they deem unfair.

How to stop regulatory capture?
- What causes capture?
	- Revolving door phenomenon
	- Lots of interaction between regulators and firms may lead to less confrontation.
- How to deal with it
	- Regulatory term limited to 5 years,
	- Revolving door dilemma
		- Experts in a field may be turned off from becoming regulators if they cannot go back to working in the industry after their term is done.
			- Regulators' salaries are much lower.
		- Employment restrictions exist depending on level of seniority.

Role of government and regulators
- Technical vs. social distinction.
	- Regulators enforce objectives whereas government sets objectives.
- Primary legislation is always a possibility. The key point is just that ministers do not intervene for political popularities without thinking of long-term ramifications.
- State-owned enterprise will also conflict with regulators which makes the independence of the regulator even more important.
