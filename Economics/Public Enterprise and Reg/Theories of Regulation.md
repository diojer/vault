# Who Wants Regulation
Consumers *and* producers might like regulation:
- Consumers want it to protect against monopoly pricing,
- Producers want it to limit entry (e.g., taxi market and licenses).

Consumers and producers might also dislike regulation:
- Consumers want to deregulate to encourage competition and lower entry barriers,
- Producers want to deregulate to consequently raise prices.
	- Potential new entrants will especially want to deregulate to lower entry barriers.
# Public Interest Theory / NPT
>Regulation exists to serve the public interest.

- Public Interest Theory was the main theory until the 1960s, going back to Adam Smith.
It is now generally referred to as "normative analysis as a positive theory" (NPT).
This means that a normative analysis (when should regulation occur) leads to a positive theory (when regulation does occur).
>Essentially, the public interest theory posits that regulation occurs when it should.
- Some argue that ==NPT is incomplete==:
	- How does public demand translate into legislation and then action by a regulator?
	- It's not really a "theory" - it just assumes that regulation will emerge where there is market failure.
- Some argue ==NPT is not based on evidence==:
	- ==Regulation doesn't seem to be correlated with the presence of externalities, diseconomies, or monopolies.==
		- E.g.: taxis, stockbrokers, ocean shipping.

Advocates of NPT may respond:
- Ineffective regulators are more of a competency problem, rather than a problem with the theory itself.
- Regulatory objectives are still generally in the public interest.
- I.e., regulation is typically created for the right reason and then badly managed.
>However, there is no theory of mismanagement within NPT.
## Empirics
- Public regulators do hold the public interest as a key objective in their statutes.
- However, NPT tends to *under-predict* regulation. It does not generally account for why some producers may *like* regulation.
# Private Interest Theories
>These can help to explain why regulation is often mismanaged.
## Capture Theory
Pre-1960 empirics suggested that regulation was pro-producer.
- For example, regulators may limit entry and thus competition.
Consequently, regulation is theorised in Capture Theory to be supplied in response to industry demand.
>However, there is not a strong theoretical basis.
- Why do environmental or safety regulations exist?
- When there are multi-sector regulators (Office of Rail and Road), which private interest is the regulator favouring (especially important if the sectors are in direct competition)?
### Empirics
- Capture theory helps to mend the hole NPT has trouble filling.
- However, Capture Theory also *under-predicts* regulation. We know that public interest is still an important factor in regulation.
## Economic Theory of Regulation
>Developed by Stigler (1971) and Peltzman (1976)
- Concerned with:
	1. Demand and supply of regulation,
	2. Consumer and firm demands for regulation,
	3. Legislators' reasons for supplying regulation, e.g., political capital,
	4. Cost of obtaining regulation,
- Regulation is not seen as a free good.

So:
- ==Regulation favours groups that are better organised and stand to gain a lot== (per capita).
	- I.e., small groups with strongly felt preferences.
	- These groups are more able to invest resources in *recognition* of the problem.
		- Within big groups, there are free-rider problems from recognition-activities *and* from implementation-activities. This further discourages bigger groups from demanding regulation.

Because consumers are such a large group, it is easier to disperse the costs over consumers without them being so acutely felt.
- Consequently, ==regulation tends to favour producers==
	- For example: US peanut import restrictions give about $11,000 extra to each peanut farmer while only costing consumers and extra $1.23 per capita.


So, which industries will be regulated?
$$
\text{Regulator's objective function: }P=P(W_{1},W_{2}) 
$$
- The objective function for political capital, given as $P$, is dependent on the incomes of both producers and consumers. The regulators essentially implement wealth-transfers from one of these groups to the other.
- This can be rewritten as:
$$
\text{Special Case: }P=P(p, \pi)
$$
- Where $p$ is price and $\pi$ is profit.
	- A lower price acts as a welfare-transfer to consumers, while a higher profit acts as a welfare-transfer to producers.
- This is subject to a constraint:
$$
\pi=f(p, c)
$$
>Putting everything together, we get:
![[Pasted image 20241107194152.png]]
- Where:
	- $M_{1}$, $M_{2}$, and $M_{3}$ represent varying indifference curves for the regulator. Along $M_{1}$, for example, any gain/loss in profit is offset by a gain/loss in price.
		- The indifference curves represent more utility for the regulator going to the *left* or *up*. This is because:
			- Left along the horizontal axis, profit stays the same while price falls (pure gain for consumers and thus the regulator).
			- Up along the vertical axis, profit increases while prices stay the same (pure gain for producers and thus the regulator).
	- With the upside-down U-shaped constraint, the optimal point $A$ is where the left-and-upmost indifference curve is tangent to the constraint.

This theory then, suggests that ==very competitive and very monopolistic industries are the most likely to be regulated== - they are in unstable equilibria and there will be a lot of political capital to gain as a regulator.
- However, the social welfare loss from regulating an already competitive industry will make regulation less likely.
	- This tends to back up the NPT hypothesis.
### Deregulation
Political changes could spur deregulation:
- Change in underlying political power of different pressure groups,
- Technological change could make it easier for certain groups to organise (e.g., marijuana deregulation).

Economic changes could also spur deregulation:
- Lower demand could bring the price naturally closer to the marginal cost, reducing the political capital transferred to regulators from producers.
### Empirics
- The Economic Theory of Regulation (ETR) helps to fill both gaps found in public interest and capture theory. However:
	- It *over-predicts* regulation. There can be regulation in competitive and monopolistic markets - so is it falsifiable?
# Independent Regulators
>The emergence of regulators may undermine the Economic Theory of Regulation.
- Political capital as a reward to the current party is less clear - independent regulators tend to be protected from government interference.
