What is a Public Enterprise?
> Definition:
> "An organisation which produces and sells goods or services and whose assets are owned not by private shareholders but by a public agency." (Rees, 1984)

A public enterprise is also sometimes referred to as a state-owned firm or nationalised industry.

Public ownership means:
- They are accountable to the government,
- They are supposed to be interested in the "public interest" rather than profit maximisation,
- There will be political interference.
They typically exist because:
- They are intended to correct market failure,
	- E.g., natural monopoly, public goods
	- Dynamic market failures, e.g., myopic private investors - car manufacturing??
- To alter the structure of payoffs, e.g., redistributing monopoly rents.

There are multiple kinds of failure in an economy:
- Public enterprise can lead to government failure,
- Un-regulated private enterprise can lead to market failure,
- Regulated private enterprise can lead to regulatory failure
