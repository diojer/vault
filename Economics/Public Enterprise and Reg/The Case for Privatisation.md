# Learning Objectives
- Understand and articulate why public enterprise may fail from a theoretical perspective.
- Understand the property rights theory that presents a theoretical rationale for why private ownership may lead to improvements in productive efficiency,
- Recognise that capital markets are not always perfect and so private capital markets will not always deliver efficient outcomes.
	- Note from lecturer - broadly they do.
- Understand other theories, such as the link between ownership, quality and corruption.
# The Public Corporation in the UK
The Public Corporation model (AKA the Morrisonian Model) is the main nationalised industry model used in the UK.
- The Board is appointed by the Government,
- Priority is the "public interest" (this idea is initially vague),
- The Government is typically kept at arms length,
- The Government decides policy while the Board decides operations.
## Nirvana Fallacy of Nationalisation
A nirvana fallacy involves substituting in a perfect alternative for an imperfect reality, rather than an imperfect alternative.
## Sources of Potential Inefficiency
### How are objectives set for state-owned enterprise?
Ministers and civil servants will typically be setting and communicating direction to state-owned enterprise. The main mechanism for ensuring that state-owned enterprises act in the public interest is to **incentivise ministers via voting intention changes**.

Problems arise due to this incentivisation mechanism, however. The political cycle, i.e., elections every five years, can lead to shorter term thinking amongst ministers. For example, energy prices may be lowered or jobs may be retained just before an election, even if this does not serve the *long-term public interest*.
Furthermore, there is a fundamental asymmetry of information between ministers and voters which can obfuscate these practises. Also:
- **Elections are never about single-issues**, so a poorly performing state-owned enterprise may be outweighed by other things voters care about,
- **There is a free-rider problem on information gathering**: researching and exposing government mismanagement provides a social benefit but requires a large sunk-cost, so voters are incentivised to "let someone else" do it.
- **Ministers often prefer ad-hoc intervention** rather than long-term planning:
	- They will typically react to problems with respect to the political climate,
	- They cannot be placed under close scrutiny by the opposition,
- Investment in public enterprise will often depend on governmental budgetary requirements, and so may depend on unrelated sectors and the greater political climate (also known as stop-go investment).
### How are state-owned enterprises monitored and incentivised?
Essentially:
- The Principal-Agent problem:
	- There are many principals, consisting of the voters of a country and government ministers. It is already difficult to align their incentives and desires to due reasons stated above.
	- To align these principals with the board is also difficult, due to possibly vague mission statements and the inability of voters to independently respond to mismanagement regardless of greater political context.
- Soft budget constraints,
- Changing government dictum can lead to uncertainty and weak monitoring of managers.
	- Objectives will likely not be set in clear, consistent and stable ways.
## Theoretical Case for Private Ownership
> Privatisation involves the sale of public enterprises and/or assets to the private sector.
- The ultimate objectives for a private enterprise are different.
	- Shareholders seek to maximise profit, rather than social welfare.
- In monitoring and incentivising management to align with the aims of the principal, there are more potential arrangements,
	- Aligning management salaries with share price,
	- Threat of bankruptcy,
	- Threat of takeover,
	- Shareholders can sell shares if they believe management is inadequate (voters cannot do this.)
	- The change in property rights, i.e., giving shareholders the rights to profits, may help with aligning principals and agents, meaning that profit maximisation (the shareholders ultimate goal) can be achieved more easily than social welfare maximisation (the government's ultimate goal).
The above are examples of *financial market discipline*. That means decentralised behavioural incentives via financial markets, rather than product markets (e.g., competition). Those latter incentives will also emerge.
### How Effective are Financial Markets in Practice?
- Free rider problem exists in both scenarios,
	- There will be an under provision of monitoring activity, due to the costs associated with independently monitoring,
- While it can be hard for small shareholders to enforce their interests, it is still more feasible than taxpayers enforcing interests in public companies:
	- Portfolios can often be managed by institutions,
	- There is internal competition for management positions rather than direct appointment by the government,
	- There exists the threat of takeover.
		- Poor performance of managers can lead to their replacement.
		- Very large firms are hard to takeover,
		- Takeovers often promote managerial interests rather than shareholder interests.

The process of privatisation can create **incentives for bribery and unfair preferential treatment to certain private individuals**. Furthermore, there are worries that while private organisation may help with productive efficiency, **it may sacrifice quality in doing so**.
