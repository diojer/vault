- Indivisibilities
	- E.g. To implement a rail service between two cities, you have to make a large initial investment to build the railway. Eventually you get to a point where full capacity is reached and you have to build a new railway.
		- Essentially, the capacity increases in fixed increments, and only when it is full is more investment required. So costs do not increase pro-rata, but instead in set increments all at once.

- But there is competition in what would be typically considered "natural monopoly" sectors, like electricity and the postal service.
	- New developments in regulation mean we can get the best of economies of scale, scope, and product markets benefits from competition.
