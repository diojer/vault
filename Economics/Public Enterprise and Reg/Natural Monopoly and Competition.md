# Defining Natural Monopoly
- The strict definition is where a firm has a cost function that is **sub additive**.
$$
C(Y)<\sum_{i}C(y_{i})~;~\sum_{i}y_{i}=Y~;~i=1,2,\dots,k~;~k\geq 2
$$
- In other words:
	- The cost of total output Y is less than the sum of the cost of that output subdivided.
	- Essentially, it is cheaper for one firm to produce the total output than to subdivide that production process between multiple firms.
	- This does not necessarily imply falling average cost over *all* output levels.

| Scale          | Increasing returns        | Constant returns | Decreasing returns                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Inputs double, | Output more than doubles. | Output doubles.  | Output increase by less than double. |
## The single product case
>Falling unit cost over all output levels are sufficient, but not necessary, for a natural monopoly to exist.
- The alternative is a weak, or non-sustainable, natural monopoly.

>AC1 represents the average costs when one firm is in the market, AC2 represents the average costs when 2 firms are in the market.
- In this industry, a weak natural monopoly exists at demand levels D1 and D2, because one firm producing the total output is cheaper than two. However, because there are not constantly falling average costs, at some point it will be cheaper for multiple firms to produce (given sufficient demand). This occurs at beyond AC1 and AC2's point of intersection and at D3.

>This is a strong natural monopoly, where it will *always* be cheaper for a single firm to produce, due to constantly falling average cost curves.
## Multi-product case
- With multiple products, we introduce *economies of scope* as well as *economies of scale*.
$$
C(q_{1},q_{2})<C(q_{1},0)+C(0,q_{2})
$$
- In other words, the cost of producing both products simultaneously is less than the total cost of producing them separately.
### Example cost functions with multiple products
$$
C(Q_{1},Q_{2})=Q_{1}+Q_{2}+(Q_{1}Q_{2})^{1/3}
$$
- The above 

- Indivisibilities
	- E.g. To implement a rail service between two cities, you have to make a large initial investment to build the railway. Eventually you get to a point where full capacity is reached and you have to build a new railway.
		- Essentially, the capacity increases in fixed increments, and only when it is full is more investment required. So costs do not increase pro-rata, but instead in set increments all at once.

- But there is competition in what would be typically considered "natural monopoly" sectors, like electricity and the postal service.
	- New developments in regulation mean we can get the best of economies of scale, scope, and product markets benefits from competition.
