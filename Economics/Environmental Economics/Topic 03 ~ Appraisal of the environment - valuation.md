# Environmental Cost-Benefit Analysis in the UK
- [The Green Book](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-green-book-appraisal-and-evaluation-in-central-government)
	- Three stage:
		1. The Strategic Outline Case (SOC),
		2. The Outline Business Case (OBC),
		3. The Full Business Case (FBC).
	- Each stage requires completion of the five case model:
		1. Strategic,
		2. Financial,
		3. Economic
		4. Management - risk and uncertainty,
		5. Commercial
	- Example:
		- Water dam being built to prevent river from drying.
		- How do we make the costs and benefits comparable in monetary terms?
		- How, given that we approve of the dam, do we compare between different projects/plans to build the dam?
- Basic Assumptions of the Valuation of non-market goods:
	- Utility changes as a result of proposed policy.
		- Example: improved water supply increases the harvest from agriculture.
	- Since utility is a monotonic function of income, we know that any increase in utility from extra water supply can always be offset by an opposite change in income.
		- This measures the Willingness to Pay for an individual experiencing the new dam.
		- This can assess the value of the dam in monetary terms - compensating variation.
	- There are different Valuation types:
		- Direct use value: consuming a good.
		- Indirect use value: using the consequences of a good, e.g., sitting in the shade of a tree you intend to harvest fruit from.
		- Option value: value from the option of use, e.g., a train that you do not use regularly but enjoy because at some point you will need to travel somewhere,
		- Bequest value: investment for future generations,
		- Existence value: the existence of a good brings utility,
		- Altruism: others' use of a good brings utility.
