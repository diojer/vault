Idea has changed to investigate labour shares in different sectors of the economy.
- Based on all reading done so far, there are little descriptive statistics available. The University of Sussex paper does investigate sectoral differences in labour share, but does not utilise the BLS' methodology, instead choosing to conduct an econometric analysis to see the elasticity of productivity and wages.
- By looking at average (mean) labour costs (available through Eurostat from the years 2001-2022 - but will probably only go until 2019 due to COVID irregularities), labour share changes in different sectors can be estimated.
	- Pre- and post-GFC changes would be interesting.
- Productivity data for different sectors is available from 1990-2020
	- I was hoping to find labour cost data pre-2001 but there doesn't seem to be any available.
