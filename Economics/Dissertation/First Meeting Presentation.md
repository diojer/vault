## Non-Preston Lit.
- Local authorities are more likely to procure locally and their spending habits tend to match SMEs up with their prevalence in the market.
- Doing business with SMEs provides some key benefits:
	1. Reliability,
	2. Flexibility,
	3. Quality of service,
	4. Innovation
- Positive discrimination can be distortionary
	- Firms want to stay within the definition,
	- However:
		- Lit. suggests it does help employment.
# Outline of model and dependent variables
>A difference-in-differences model is most likely the best way to test this.
- Past studies have a clear methodology but I still have some questions:
	- Synthetic control seems like a good idea but I have read the underlying papers by Abadie and it does seem somewhat complicated.
- Will run in the same timespan as the Lancet study because the effects of COVID-19 may break the parallel trend assumption.
## Dependent Variables:
- How much contract value is being awarded to SMEs
- Changes in government spending
	- This is an attempt to measure the change in the cost basis for the local authority, but I'm not sure it's the best way to capture it.
	- LA deficit could be better.
		- ==Specific spending on tendering would be much better==
