- Current regression isn't indicative of much but does point to the ppi-adjusted values being closer to correlation than cpi-adjusted values.
- Most papers looking at the labour-productivity gap tend to exclude agriculture
- Talk over index composition for unknown/aggregated industries.
- Talk about ASHE survey and combining SIC03 and SIC07
	- Allows comparison of inter- and intra-firm compensation-productivity correlations,
	- To convert between SIC03 and SIC07, just make some assumptions: 2009 weights can be applied throughout, another assumption where they can only be applied with majority.
- I want to use econometrics to support main visual data which ties into theoretical discussion, rather than have the entire paper focussed on econometrics.
- Theoretical talk:
	- Neoclassical models emphasise that compensation should approach the marginal product of labour,
		- If productivity is increasing the MPL must be increasing, although productivity=/=MPL
		- Therefore, compensation should be increasing in tandem.
	- UK Government has written that the labour share has increased by 4.3% from 1997-2023
		- Information on per-industry changes, however, they use quite broad industries and do not examine the size of discrepancies: for example, I found a very large discrepancy in agriculture but this is not shown in pure labour share stats.
	- If compensation does not increase with productivity, then what other models and production functions potentially arise?
		- If compensation does increase with productivity, then does this reinforce the neoclassical aggregate production function?
