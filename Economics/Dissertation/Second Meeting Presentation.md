# Plan
1. There is definitely information on procurement records, however it is incomplete.
On Preston's website, they have all council spending over £250 from 2018Q2-2024Q2.
- Necessary timeframe is around 2010Q1-2019Q4, so this covers very little.
- However, gov.uk website hosts spending over £500 from May 2010-Oct 2011.
	- This now covers almost 4/9 years (not bad).
The Local government transparency code 2015 mandates that all councils publish expenditures exceeding £500.
- I can probably issue a FOI request to get the missing information from 2015-2019.
	- The years missing will be 2011Q4-2014Q4.
		- I will issue a FOI request for these too.
Lancaster City Council website (includes data from Preston) says there are no payments from Dec 2022 onwards due to a new system - this could be the case with past migrations. However I am hopeful that there will still be a record somewhere.
2. Once this information is available, I can use my programming skills and the gov.uk Companies House API access to automatically go through all of the contract beneficiaries and see where they are located.
	- I could try to plot them on a map, it would look cool. However, the most important thing is to calculate what percentage are located in Preston each year.
3. This process is then repeated for the other councils on the list!
	- It's a long process. Once the programming is done the most time-consuming thing will probably be finding the data.

All of the above is irrelevant, FOI request made it explicitly clear that as a council Preston doesn't keep records from before 2018 and it looks like there is no way to recover them.

Way forward:
- Switch dissertation topic,
- Change regression to examine something else - not really sure what I'd examine other than trying to replicate the original paper, but I don't think I currently have the ability to do synthetic control or propensity score matching.
	- Could do nearest neighbour - especially because the university upgrade in Lancaster could then be controlled for?

Switching topic to investigate the wage productivity gap:
