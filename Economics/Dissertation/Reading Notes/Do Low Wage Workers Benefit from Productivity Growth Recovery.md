# Abstract
- Effects of labour productivity on wages are analysed.
	- At the firm, industry and city levels.
	- Wages are analysed across different age cohorts, wage quintiles, and unionised workers.
- Only nominal wage elasticity to industry-level productivity is statistically significant, very small, and negative: -0.03.
	- Elasticity is nil for manufacturing, and negative, albeit very small, for business services.
# Intro
- LP has been broadly flat but heterogenous across industries.
- After the 2008 recession, UK employment fell relatively less than other OECD economies.
	- It also recovered faster.
	- Literature suggests that firms responded to the crisis by hoarding labour, possibly reducing hours rather than making redundancies.
- This paper addresses whether there has been decoupling on two senses:
	- Decoupling from average real wages and productivity, and
	- Decoupling from median real wages and productivity,
	- As a systemic change to the relationship between wages and productivity, rather than due to confounding factors.
- At the firm level, firms may increase wages following productivity gains due to unionisation, efficiency wages, or risk sharing.
	- Due to low levels of unionisation in the UK, we can rule this out.
- At the industry level, if wages and productivity do share positive elasticities, then gains to workers may only be passed on during job changes, or due to:
	- Firm's strategic imitation,
	- Competition,
		- Efficiency wages,
- At the local labour market level, wages may be tied to urban premia and geographical agglomeration of activities.

This paper studies the distributive outcomes of rent-sharing elasticities (that is, whether rent-sharing differs across age and wage distributions). It also studies the roles of unions, and finally extends its analysis to non-manufacturing sectors.
- They find that elasticities are either quite small or negative, implying full decoupling.
- In the manufacturing sector, there is no evidence of rent sharing.
- Across wage quintiles and age cohorts, firm level productivity improvements mainly benefit ==low wage occupations and young workers==.
	- At the industry level, productivity growth may lead to increased wage inequality, because of the disproportionate positive impact only for top quintile earners in construction and transport.
# Lit Review
- Carlsson et al. 2016 investigate whether changes to wages mainly result from productivity growth originating mainly at the firm or industry level.
	- They find that industry level effects are on average three times larger than idiosyncratic firm level effect.
		- ==In other words, workers in Sweden over the period considered benefited more from competitors' gains in productivity than increased productivity in the company employing them.==
- Juhn et al. 2018
	- Finds that US firms do rent share, but elasticities are very small. In retail and professional services, only 7% and 5% of gains are passed on via wages. In manufacturing, only 2% of gains are passed on.
	- No relationship is found in the financial sector.
	- Workers in the bottom quintile of earners do not benefit or suffer from changes in wages due to firm performance.
# Method
- Hourly wages are used to exclude changes due to reductions in hours worked
	- Authors argue that, because of labour hoarding following the great recession, the number of working hours were reduced which would have led to a drop in income. If using annual or weekly earnings, results would be biased.
- The econometric equation used looks only at wages in time $t$ compared to productivity at time $t$
	- To me this seems a major methodological weakness, as there is no lag expected between changes in productivity and wages, even though this lag likely exists [[Productivity and Pay~ Is the link broken]].
- Labour productivity is also estimated using 2SLS by instrumenting with Total Factor Productivity - this is to remove effects of technological improvements on productivity.
	- Labour productivity is estimated as GVA/hour
# Results
- Baseline,
	- ![[Pasted image 20250302131114.png]]
	- Positive effects of LP at the firm level only found 2011-2015, positive effects at city level only found 2009-2010. Industry level generally negative.
- Basically LP sucks for wages. Very few positive elasticities.
