# General Notes
- A £1 increase in productivity was found to increase average compensation by £0.28, median compensation by £0.35
	- The effect is small and points toward a general decoupling.
		- ==Why not do an elasticity analysis?==
- Productivity is measured as nominal GVA per hour, rather than NVA or RGVA.

- Inequality due to labour productivity has decreased,
	- Effects of labour productivity on median wages are higher than on average wages.
		- This means that productivity increases are better for lower earners.
- Slough and Heathrow lag heavily behind the rest of London in wage growth,
- In most sectors there is no statistical significance between labour productivity and wages, but there are a few key sectors with significant coefficients that can explain a lot of the aggregate correlation.
- Real wages in London are not higher than in the rest of the country, but productivity increases are, on average, rewarded with higher increases in wages. 

In summary:
- Labour productivity across GB grew substantially between 2004-2014, with London leading.
- Wage differences across labour markets have been shrinking,
	- Wage differences within labour markets have been increasing, i.e., inequality.
- The link between wages and productivity is weaker at the firm level than the labour market level.
	- Firms are less likely to share productivity gains with workers but labour markets may force wage increases.
- Catch up dynamics for wages and productivity are different.
	- Lower-income labour markets catch up in wages - there is a negative correlation between wages in 2004 and the 10-year wage growth.
	- High-productivity labour markets grew faster in productivity than low-productivity labour markets, indicating no catch-up effect (instead, a fall-behind effect).

# Lit Review
- [[Do Low Wage Workers Benefit from Productivity Growth Recovery|Ciarli et al. 2018]] find significant industry heterogeneity: the positive elasticity of wages to productivity is concentrated in some services rather than in the manufacturing sector.
- Card et al 2018 offer a comprehensive review of the rent-sharing mechanism and find that since the 2008 crisis, the elasticities of wages with respect to value added per worker is in the range of 0.05-0.15.
- Pessoa and Van Reenen (2014) show that UK nationwide productivity and remuneration follow each other closely, however this paper argues that there exists no current evidence on whether this relationship holds across different local labour markets.
# Method and Results
- Like their other paper [[Do Low Wage Workers Benefit from Productivity Growth Recovery|Ciarli et al. 2018]], this paper does not investigate lagged effects, only current effects.
	- Again, this seems like a big oversight.
