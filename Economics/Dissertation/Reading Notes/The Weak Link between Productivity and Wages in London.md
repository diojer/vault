# General Notes
- Inequality due to labour productivity has decreased,
	- Effects of labour productivity on median wages are higher than on average wages.
		- This means that productivity increases are better for lower earners.
- Slough and Heathrow lag heavily behind the rest of London in wage growth,
- In most sectors there is no statistical significance between labour productivity and wages, but there are a few key sectors with significant coefficients that can explain a lot of the aggregate correlation.
- Real wages in London are not higher than in the rest of the country, but productivity increases are, on average, rewarded with higher increases in wages. 

In summary:
- Labour productivity across GB grew substantially between 2004-2014, with London leading.
- Wage differences across labour markets have been shrinking,
	- Wage differences within labour markets have been increasing, i.e., inequality.
- The link between wages and productivity is weaker at the firm level than the labour market level.
	- Firms are less likely to share productivity gains with workers but labour markets may force wage increases.
- Catch up dynamics for wages and productivity are different.
	- Lower-income labour markets catch up in wages - there is a negative correlation between wages in 2004 and the 10-year wage growth.
	- High-productivity labour markets grew faster in productivity than low-productivity labour markets, indicating no catch-up effect (instead, a fall-behind effect).
