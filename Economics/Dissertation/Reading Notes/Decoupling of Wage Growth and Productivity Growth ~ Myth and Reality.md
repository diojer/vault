# Abstract
- It is widely believed that in the US wage growth has fallen massively behind productivity growth. Recently, it is suggested the UK is starting to follow a similar path.
- Analysts point to the faster growth of GDP per hour than median wages.
- This paper distinguishes between "net" and "gross" decoupling.
	- Net decoupling measures changes in the labour share, i.e., the difference in growth between GDP and mean labour costs adjusted using an output price index.
	- Gross decoupling measures the difference in growth between GDP and **median wages deflated by CPI**.
- They argue that a stable labour share is expected, i.e., no net decoupling. This is found to be the case for the UK.
- The difference between gross and net decoupling, therefore, can be accounted for by three factors:
	- Inequality - i.e., divergence between median and mean,
	- Compensation vs. wages - the former includes non-wage benefits which are labour costs for employers,
	- Differences in deflators - they argue this is only relevant in the US and not found to be relevant in the UK.
- They find that these three factors can explain basically all gross decoupling, meaning there has been very little net decoupling.
# Intro
- ![[Pasted image 20250302143331.png]]
- ==The share of labour in national accounts is used as a cross-check.==
- They also analyse trends in productivity and wages at the industry level.
	- No evidence is found of net decoupling except in "non-market" sectors of real estate, health, education and public administration.
		- They suspect this is because of difficulty of measurement of value added in those sectors.
- Clear evidence is found of gross decoupling, and inequality specifically is found to be a major issue.
# Decoupling Theory
- Mainstream economic theory predicts that net decoupling stays constant over time. Changes could occur for some reasons, such as:
	- Short-run shocks,
	- Technological changes that are biased against labour,
	- An increase in the profit mark-up - could be a result of weakened competition,
	- A fall in workers' bargaining power,
	- Changes in effective labour supply - globalisation, immigration, female participation.
- Net decoupling relationship is robust to changes in the composition of the workforce - labour share stays constant even if productivity changes due to migration shocks, because theoretically compensation and productivity rise/fall in tandem.

- Gross decoupling is equal to:
$$
GD=ND+\text{Inequality}+\text{Wage wedge} + \text{Price wedge}
$$
- Where:
	- GD is gross decoupling,
	- ND is net decoupling,
	- Inequality refers to the difference between mean and median wage,
	- Wage wedge refers to the difference between wages and total compensation,
	- Price wedge refers to the difference between output and consumer price indices.
- Gross decoupling is important because it captures pass-through of productivity to the middle worker's compensation.
	- CPI deflation also captures the true cost of living.
		- However, it may distort investigation into productivity pass-through.
# Data and Analysis
- Hours is better than workers because of part-time work, i.e., robust to changes in hours worked.
- GDP and GVA differ slightly
	- GDP includes taxes minus subsidies
- GDP and GVA are used rather that NDP and NVA.
- ASHE vs LFS
	- Follow each other closely.
	- LFS has grown more slowly than ASHE because it includes the self employed.
	- Self employed earnings are hard to define in terms of labour v. capital.
	- ASHE has much more intricate detail but LFS goes on for slightly longer.

Inequality and non-wage benefits make up 32.5% of the 42.5% gross decoupling statistic found by the paper.
- The definition of inequality should be made clear: gains from productivity improvements disproportionately go toward higher income earners than the "middle worker".

Summary on decoupling in UK
- 1972-2010 compensation and productivity grew at the same rate. No net decoupling.
- A large wedge did open up between median wages and mean compensation.
	- Benefits of extra productivity disproportionately went toward higher earners.
	- Growth of non-wage compensation.
