# Introduction
In 2010 the coalition government announced that they would attempt to improve the chances of small businesses in winning public sector contracts.
- Small firms may be prohibited from attaining these because they lack the time and resources to devote to a complex tendering process.

The small business sector has indicated that direct purchase of their products and services is a good and direct means of helping them to trade and develop new markets.

The UK public sector's spending (Â£238bn) makes up about 15% of total demand.

Acting as a subcontractor for a larger firm may be a way for small businesses to engage in the tendering process.

Nearly 3/4 of SMEs never or rarely tender for public sector work.
- Only 16% of contract value was won by SMEs in 2007
# The Public Sector as a Customer
The literature is broadly in agreement that public sector organisations are attractive customers.
- They provide stability.
- Small suppliers are willing to accept some instability for a reduction in the cost burden imposed by bureaucratic regulation.
- Public sector provision provides prestige.

41% of SMEs never tender for work with the private sector.
- 29% tender only rarely
# Measuring SME representation
This is typically represented as the value of contracts awarded to SMEs as a percentage of total value.
- Fairness is then judged by comparing this with the involvement of SMEs in the wider economy.

Another important aspect to consider is the representation of different tiers of the public sector.
- This diversity may impact upon SME supply differently.

SMEs are often distinguished according to age, maturity, or size.
- New firms feature as a separate category,
- Firms are also subdivided into size - (0-49, 50-249) or (0-9, 10-49, 50-249).
# Current scale of SME representation
Bovis (1996) reported the SME share of public procurement at 14.31%.
- This was deemed disproportionately low, given that they contributed 50% to annual turnover while representing 99% of all UK enterprise.

Another survey determined that SMEs make up 71% of total suppliers but only 30% of spending.

The BERR (2007) reported that 16% of contract value was awarded to SMEs by central government and agencies.
- This was 50% of the *number* of contracts awarded.

Reed et al. (2005) proposed two new measurements:
1. The number of small businesses receiving contracts,
2. The number of new small businesses.
This apparently provides a better indication of freshness and innovation in the procurement process.

Local authorities were much more successful at engaging with SMEs.
- BERR reported 60% of contract value from LAs was awarded,
- Glover (2008) brought the figure up to 37.7% of central and civil government spending on SMEs.
	- The supply to LAs was 52.97%
- Authorities wonder if pressure on LAs to procure more cheaply and efficiently may have strained this relationship.
- Loader (2005) examined the SME side rather than the public sector side and found that 60% of SMEs in Teesside supplied the public sector.
- ==Local authorities are likely more ready to engage with SMEs as they are likely to be more local companies which fall under the remit of LAs.==
# SME contribution to policy objectives
Some benefits are:
- Enhanced competition in the marketplace,
- More innovation,
- Improvements in local and regional development,

Pickernell et al (2011) suggests that local public procurement can support employment but suggests that the benefits of innovation are best secured at a centralised level.

The NERA Economic Consulting (2005) study developed a cost-benefit framework to evaluate SMEs with other supply sources.

The Office of Government Commerce and the Small Business Services produced a document (*Smaller Supplier... Better Value?*) which argued for small suppliers.
- Better value for money:
	- Responsiveness,
	- Flexibility,
	- Specialist knowledge,
	- Innovativeness,
	- Quality of service,
	- Lower cost.
Glover (2008) acknowledged these benefits are still relevant.
- Glover also reiterated in 2008 (difficult economic circumstances) that SMEs can provide cost savings for the taxpayer, i.e., value for money.
	- This is typically associated with benefits of economies of scale and scope.

# Remedies to improve SME supply
1. Changing the environment:
	- Positive discrimination toward small firms,
	- Targeting SME proportion of value,
	- Recognising the potential of subcontracting as a means of SMEs to obtain a share of public work.
	- However:
		- Transparency and equal treatment are seen to enhance open and fair competition. Consequently, authorities tend to prioritise improving SME access to contracts rather than positive discrimination.
			- The USA provides the best evidence base for examining effects of positive discrimination, because they have a minimum quota for contract value going toward SMEs.
				- Denes (1997) argues that the US approach is not more costly - which the EU posits - due to the fact of competition for contracts.
				- Clark and Moutray (2004) raise concerns about US definitions of small business,
				- Glover (2008) found that, while more government contracts were awarded to SMEs, there was distortion in the market due to firms wanting to retain the label, rather than grow beyond it and face a market with no support.
			- Glover (2008) found that, while a quota can give a strong signal to SMEs about government support, there were too many disadvantages:
				- In particular, the inadequacy of using one target in a diverse market situation.
				- While a target was rejected, periodic reports should identify the percentage of value going to SMEs. Furthermore, an aspirational goal can signal support without damaging the market or value for money.
2. Changing the procurement process:
	- Better information,
	- Reducing burden of dealing with bureaucracy, which is often regressive,
	- Organising events like "meet-the-buyer",
	- Unbundling large contracts.
