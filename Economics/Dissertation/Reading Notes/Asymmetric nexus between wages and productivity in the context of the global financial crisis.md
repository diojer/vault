# Abstract
- Investigates nexus since 2008-09.
- Uses NARDL framework and quarterly data.
- Find that productivity - both in the aggregate and specifically in the retail sector - have significant and positive impact on wages.
	- The impact in the retail sector is many times smaller than the aggregate,
	- GDP growth, inflation, and unemployment rates are found to have effects on wage growth over the short term. In the long run, productivity is the sole statistically significant influence on wages.
# Intro
Decent wages are considered a sign of socio-economic progress.
Wage growth is a crucial part of the public policy debate.
# Conclusion and Policy Implications
- Wages are sticky downward, meaning that decreasing productivity has little effect on aggregate wages.
- Wages may sometimes see a greater-than-proportional increase following a unit increase in productivity,
- There are short- and long-term differences,
	- Impact of productivity on wages in more profound in the long- than short-term.
	- Supports Krugman's remark,
- Policy focus should be on increasing productivity within all sectors,
