- Analysis of mean and median wages in the US across the whole economy.
- Substantial evidence of linkage between productivity and compensation:
	- 1pp higher productivity led to 0.7pp higher median compensation, not statistically significant from 1pp.

- Median/non-supervisory wages:
	- Median is preferred because of its clear definition, while nonsupervisory definitions tend to exclude or include individuals unknowingly.
	- Both capture "typical" workers' pay and so are good measures to see whether increases in productivity translate into compensation increase for most people.

- Evidence clearly supports a substantial linkage between productivity and typical worker compensation.
	- Instead of a broken link, paper suggests differences are more to do with factors not associated with productivity growth.
		- Explanations for possible causes, mainly attributed to rising income inequality and the falling labour share, include:
			- Technological progress,
			- Education and skills,
			- Globalisation,
			- Institutions,
			- Market power.
		- Technology focused theories have a testable implication which is what this paper aims to test.
			- "If the primary cause of the productivity-pay divergence is technological progress, then periods of faster productivity growth should coincide with faster growth in divergence."
# Lit Review
- Bivens and Michel (2015) explain why gross labour productivity (GLP) growing faster than net labour productivity (NLP) is important.
	- It implies a higher rate of depreciation.
- Net labour productivity has growth faster than average compensation deflated by a PPI deflator: labour share has therefore fallen.
	- Almost no UK studies look at net productivity, most only look at gross value added.
