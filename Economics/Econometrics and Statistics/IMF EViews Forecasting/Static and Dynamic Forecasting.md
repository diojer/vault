- Static Forecasting:
	- Uses known values for the endogenous variable in the model, if say the model is in AR terms.
- Dynamic Forecasting:
	- Uses forecasted values for the endogenous variable, as there are no known values available.

Both methods have forecasting errors, however dynamic forecasting allows forecast errors to build up.

For example, forecast in-sample from 2011-2013, dynamic uses own forecasts the whole time whereas static will refer back to known values for whole time period.
