There are different kinds of nonstationarity.
- Deterministic trend, i.e., non-random function of time;
	- $y=\mu+\beta t+u_{t}$ where $u_{t}$ is iid.
- Stochastic trend:
	- Random walk: $y_{t}=y_{t-1}+u_{t}$
	- Random walk w/ drift: $y_{t}=\alpha+ y_{t-1}+u_{t}$

Consequences of nonstationarity:
- Shocks don't "die out".
- Non-normal distribution of test-statistics.
- Bias in AR coefficients.
