# Introduction
There is a strong link between fixed exchange rates and low inflation.
- This results from a discipline effect (political costs of abandoning the peg) and a confidence effect (greater willingness to hold domestic company).
- Low inflation is associated with fixed exchange rates also because low-inflation countries are more capable of fixing an exchange rate.
	- There is also evidence of causality in the other direction.
# Classifying Regimes
Regimes span a continuum, ranging from pegs to target zones, to floats with heavy, light, or no, intervention.

Regimes can be de jure, i.e., according to a commitment by the central bank, or de facto, i.e., according to observed behaviour of the exchange rate.
- These can be decoupled, i.e., a country which claims to peg their exchange rate may have volatile exchange rate fluctuations, and another country's currency may experience very little movement even though there is no public commitment to maintain a peg.
# Inflation
Policymakers long maintain that a peg can be anti-inflationary.
- Highly visible commitment,
- Stronger readiness to hold domestic currency.
	- Increases money demand so that increases in money supply are not so inflationary.
