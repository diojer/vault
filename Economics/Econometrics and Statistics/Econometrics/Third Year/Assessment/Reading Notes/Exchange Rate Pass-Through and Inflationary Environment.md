# Introduction
The degree to which changes in the exchange rate pass-through to prices is important: it can allow for greater or lesser freedom when pursuing independent monetary policy and can make it easier to implement inflation targeting.

Traditional literature is concerned with exchange rate pass-through to import prices.
- Import price pass-through is essentially determined by microeconomic factors that are exogenous to monetary policy.

An alternative view put forward by Taylor (2000) argues that declines in the pass-through are a result of a low inflation environment.
- Firms set prices for several periods in advance, so their prices respond more to cost increases (due to exchange rate depreciation) if cost changes are perceived to be sustained.
	- High inflation regimes tend to have more persistent costs.
	- A high inflation environment would thus lead to an increase in the exchange rate pass-through.

Campa and Golberg (2001) find that higher inflation and exchange rate volatility are positively associated with higher import price pass-through.
- However, the microeconomic factors play a much more important role in determining pass-through.
