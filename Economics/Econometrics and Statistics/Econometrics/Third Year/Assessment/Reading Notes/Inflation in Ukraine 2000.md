>The Relationship between price level, money supply and exchange rate in Ukraine.
# Abstract
The relationship between CPI, money supply and exchange rates are estimated using Identified Vector Autoregression Approach.

The results show that exchange rate shocks significantly influence price level behaviour.
- Exchange rate can serve as an efficient intermediate target for monetary policy.
There is some evidence that positive money supply shocks can lead to a rise in the price level.
- The influence is not very strong, which can be explained by fluctuations in demand.
- There is strong evidence that money supply responds to monetary contraction, which is caused by the inflation-targeting policy of the National Bank of Ukraine.
# Introduction
For a long time the National Bank of Ukraine targeted exchange rates as the primary goal of monetary policy. Now, the exchange rate is supported but it is not the main goal of monetary policy.
# Literature
The existence of a clear relationship between inflation and variables controllable by the central bank (interest rates, money supply, exchange rates) is the main goal.

Inflation is costly for countries, not just for citizens.
- It is estimated that the extra amount of cash necessary to conduct daily transactions accounts for 1% of GDP when examining moderate to high levels of inflation.
	- For rates of inflation lower than 10% these costs are below 0.1% of GDP.
	- In Ukraine inflation was above 20% for ten months of 1999.
- It becomes more profitable to invest in the financial, rather than productive, sector.
	- Potential profit in the financial sector rises more than in the productive sector with price instability.
	- According to Mishkin and Posen (1997), the financial market's share of GDP increases by 1% for each 10% increase in inflation (up to an inflation rate of 100%).
- It distorts productive decisions because of uncertainty in future relative prices, which are crucial for planning investment.
- As taxes are rarely indexed for nominal wage growth (which tends to increase with inflation), inflation pushes people into higher tax brackets despite unchanging (or falling) real incomes (this is called fiscal drag).
The above costs reduce the level of productive employment, slowing down growth. As a result, economists and policymakers agree price stability is very important, and should be the main goal of monetary policy.

One way of using the exchange rate to cool inflation is to fix the rate with another national currency.
- This regime is highly transparent and lowers inflation expectations.
- It is not easy to maintain fixed exchange rates.
	- This strategy often leads to depletion of foreign reserves and a balance of payments crisis.
	- In Ukraine, exchange rate targeting was abandoned because the central bank could not undertake currency intervention.

Another way is inflation rate targeting.
- The regime is transparent, i.e., easily understood by the public.
- Different targets can be used and switched between according to their performance.
Bernanke et al. (1999 p.283) suggest that, while inflation targeting may not reduce the costs of disinflation, it helps central banks to sustain price stability in the longer run by increasing transparency of policy and the accountability of the monetary policymakers.

Prerequisites for inflation targeting:
- Operational independence, but *not* goal independence. The government can choose the goal (2% inflation target, e.g.,) but the central bank should decide which instruments to choose to achieve this goal.
	- Fiscal dominance over monetary policy often leads to automatic financing of budget deficits and fiscally driven inflation.
	- In Ukraine, automatic financing of the budget deficit is restricted. Instead, the Ukrainian government mostly finances its debt by issuing government bonds.
- No commitment to another nominal anchor, like exchange rate.
	- Inflation caused by non-exchange-rate related factors, such as excess domestic aggregate demand, should not be disinflated by fixing exchange rates.
		- In an inflationary situation, the interest rate would increase. However, an increase in the interest rate increases the value of the currency. To fix the exchange rate, the central bank would have to lower the interest rate, which makes the initial response moot.
	- A fixed exchange rate regime subordinates a country's monetary policy.
- Finally, the central bank must be able to issue its own accurate and appropriate model of inflation.
# Results
Although the AIC test reported 2 lags as the optimal, Holod (2000) used 3 as 2 lengths would not be enough to capture the adjustment process and researchers have some discretion.

For the ADF, common practice is to use $p-1$ lagged differences, where $p$ is the number of lags in the general model.

Exchange rate shocks significantly influence the behaviour of the price level.
- Exchange rate depreciation leads to a permanent increase in the price level.
- This speaks to the influence of imported goods on the rest of the supply chain and consumers.
