1. Why is the CPI autocorrelation increasing when I add more lags???
	- It does take it away idiot
2. Any reason why my variables aren't cointegrated?
	- No but it doesn't matter
3. I'm getting very insignificant results (probably normal tbh)
	- thats fine

4. Why does adding a drift make the things appear drift stationary when they are obviously not????
	1. Just no need to difference it
5. M3 <- any need to justify this?
---
6. Should I first include the trend term when doing BG testing
7. If I find that for the first country, M3, XR and GEP are all drift-stationary, then should I assume for panel data estimation that they are drift stationary across all countries? If not what to do...
8. Can ARDL constraint be extended due to autocorrelation?
9. Can ARMA constraint be extended due to autocorrelation?
	- Is correlogram enough to check for autocorrelation in ARMA? BG test not working
10. Can I ask how to interpret the coefficient of a differenced logged variable or no?
