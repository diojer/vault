1. $wage_{i}=\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}educ_{i}+e_{i}$
	1. $\text{wage}_{i}=6.39+1.44educ_{i}$
		1. $SE(\beta_{1})=1.025$
		2. $SE(\beta_{2})=0.694$
	2. $R^2=0.98$
2. This $R^2$ suggests that 98% of the variation in wages from the mean can be explained by the level of education.
3. This model likely has extremely good fit for the data.
4. Â£1=$1.39
	1. If hourly earnings were measured in dollars rather than pounds, $\beta_{1}$ and $\beta_{2}$ would be multiplied by 1.39.
5. The variance in the years of schooling has likely decreased, because
