# Changing Units
Take the equation: $\hat{y}_{i} =50+0.2x_{i}$.
Say that the equation represents the relationship between income, x, and food expenditure, y. So:
- $b_{2}=2$.
- $b_{1}=50$.
If we say that y is in £s, then for every extra £1 received in income, we would spend £0.2 on food expenditure.

If we change food expenditure to be expressed in 1000s of pounds, i.e., divided by 1000, then $b_{1},b_{2}$ are divided by 1000.

If we change income to be expressed in 1000s of pounds, i.e., divided by 1000, then $b_{2}$ is multiplied by 1000.
# Changing Variance
Changing the sample variance changes the variance of $b_{1}$ and $b_{2}$ in the same direction.
- This essentially increases the error term, so it makes sense that it would make the estimators less accurate.
Changing the variance of the explanatory variable $x_{i}$ changes the variance of $b_{1}$ and $b_{2}$ in the opposite direction
- If we sample more individuals across different strata, it makes sense that the accuracy of our coefficients would actually increase.
