# Algebraic Properties
- $\sum^n_{i=1}\hat{e}_{i}=0$
- $\bar{y}=\bar{\hat{y}_{i}}$
	- In other words, the mean of x and y lies on the line.
- $\sum^n_{i=1}x_{i}\hat{e}_{i}=0$
# Goodness of Fit
The coefficient of determination, $R^2$, is a measurement of good fit. 
It tells us how much the variation of $y$ about the mean is explained by the independent variable $x$.
- It is the fraction of the components of residuals that are explained by the fitted regression.

The total sum squared, TSS, is equal to the explained sum squared, ESS, plus the residual sum squared, RSS.

In other words, $R^2=\frac{ESS}{TSS}$, or $R^2=1-\frac{RSS}{TSS}$
