# Example 1
What is the price-elasticity of demand for good x?
$D_{X}=f(P,P_{s},P_{x},I)$
Where
- P is the price
- Ps is the substitute price
- Px is the complementary good price
- I is income
The econometric model uses the economic theory, but adds an error term:
$D_{X}=f(P,P_{s},P_{x},I)+e$
## Linear Econometrics Model
$D_{X}=\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}P+\beta_{3}P_{s}+\beta_{4}P_{x}+\beta_{5}I+e$
Where
- $\beta_{1,2,..,3}$ is an unknown parameter
To find the price-elasticity, we want to find $\beta_{2}$.
### Statistical Interference
#### Estimation
We can use point or interval estimators for $\beta_{2}$
#### Hypothesis Testing
Using our estimate, we can find whether the data supports our alternate hypothesis and what our confidence level is.
#### Forecasting
Using an econometrics model, we could forecast the demand for good x next year.

How does foreign direct investment affect productivity growth?
## Population
We usually care about a particular parameter of the population, like the average.
## Sample
We use the sample to get the 'best estimate' of the value of the population parameter we are interested in.
## Data Types
### Cross Sectional Data
Data about different units, for a particular point in time.
### Time Series Data
Information about one specific measure, over a period of time
### Panel Data
Combination of both, many different measures over a period of time.
## Econometric Methods
### OLS estimator
Ordinarily Least Square
Best method given that a series of assumptions are satisfied.
### ML estimator
Maximum Likelihood
### GMM estimator
Generalised Method of Momentous
