$\text{max }f(x,y) \text{ subject to }g(x,y)=c$
Suppose we get $x^*$ and $y^*$ as the solutions.
- These optimal solutions depend on the constraint function.
	- So, the optimal solution for $x$ is a function which depends on the constraint:
		- $x^*=x^*(c)$
		- Same with $y$
	- The rate at which the optimal values of the objective function change with respect to changes in the constraint constant $c$ is the Lagrangian Multiplier
		- In other words, $\lambda$
		- In economics, this is called a "shadow price"
