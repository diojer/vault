Most mathematical examples used in economics involve a system of equations with *n* unknowns.
The best way to solve these equations is to express the coefficients in matrix/vector form.

Cramer's rule provides a simple way of solving a system of equations using determinants.

- If we want to calculate $x$, we replace the first, $y$ the second and $z$ the last.
	- There likely isn't a need to calculate $z$ using this method since you can find it out once you have $x$ and $y$.
