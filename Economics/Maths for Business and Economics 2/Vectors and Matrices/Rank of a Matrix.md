The order of the largest square submatrix whose determinant is not 0.
E.g., a $3 \times 3$ matrix with a determinant $\neq 0$ has rank 3.
# Two Important Properties of Rank
Let A be an $m \times m$ matrix. If P and Q are invertible, $m \times m$ and $n \times n$ matrices, then,
- rank (AQ) = rank (A) = rank (PA)
- rank (PAQ) = rank (A)
The rank of the transpose is the same as the rank of a matrix.
