# What is a Vector?
A vector is a series of numbers that tells us a specific point, its direction, and its magnitude.
## Row Vector
$p=(p_{1},p_{2},p_{3},\dots,p_{n})$
## Column Vector
$p=\begin{pmatrix} p_{1}\\p_{2}\\p_{3}\\\dots\\p_{n} \end{pmatrix}$
# Vector Operations
## Rules
- Both vectors must have the same dimension, $n$.
- If a and b are two $n$-vectors, $a+b$ is equal to a vector where each component is the sum of the corresponding components in a and b.
	- Vice-versa with $a-b$
- If two $n$-vectors have equal components, they are equal.
## Dot product/Inner product
$(a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3})\cdot(b_{1},b_{2},b_{3})=\sum_{i=1}^{n}(a_{i}b_{i})$
### Rules
- $a\cdot b=b \cdot a$
- $a \cdot (b+c)=a \cdot b + a \cdot c$
- $(ta)\cdot b=a \cdot(tb)$, where $t$ is any scalar.
- $a \cdot a >0 \leftrightarrow a \neq 0$
### Example
$(1,2,2)\cdot(2,3,3)=(1\cdot2)+(2\cdot 3)+(3 \cdot 3)=17$
