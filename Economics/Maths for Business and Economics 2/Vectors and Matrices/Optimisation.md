# Unconstrained
We take $f(x,y)$ to be a twice differentiable function.
- There is a stationary point at $(x^{*},y^*)$.
	- So, the partial first derivatives will be equal to 0 at $(x^{*},y^*)$.
- We want to maximise the function with respect to a constraint (even though this is called unconstrained optimisation).
## Sufficient Conditions for Maximum
- $f_{xx}\leq 0;f_{yy}\leq 0$
- $f_{xx}\cdot f_{yy}-f_{xy}^2\geq 0$
## Sufficient Conditions for Minimum
- $f_{xx}\geq 0;f_{yy}\geq 0$
- $f_{xx}\cdot f_{yy}-f_{xy}^2\geq 0$
## Sufficient Conditions for Saddle Point
- $f_{xx}\cdot f_{yy}-f_{xy}^2\lt 0$
## Unconstrained Optimisation
We use the constraint function, for example $x+y=500$, and change it into $x=500-y$. Then, we can substitute this function into our utility/profit function, and optimise.
- This is called unconstrained because we remove the constraint function.
