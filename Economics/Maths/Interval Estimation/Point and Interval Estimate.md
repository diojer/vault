A point estimate tells us an exact number. For example, a point estimate of the population mean could be:
- The average family in the UK has 2.5 children.

An interval estimate tells us a range with a confidence interval. For example, an interval estimate of the population mean could be:
- The average family in the UK has between 2 and 3 children, with 95% confidence.

A point estimate is unlikely to be exactly correct, and will change when we gather more samples. An interval estimate is more likely to be correct, but tells us less about the true population mean.
