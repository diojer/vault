Estimators should be *unbiased* and *efficient* (i.e., having low variance). However, sometimes two estimators may have different biases and different efficiencies. To figure out which is better, we calculate their **mean square error**.
$$
MSE=Variance+Bias^2
$$
A lower $MSE$ is a good thing.
When an estimator is unbiased, $MSE=Variance$.
