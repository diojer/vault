The function that gives you the relative likelihood of a particular range.

It is the derivative of the [[Probability Distribution Function]].

E.g., our function is f(x)
We must define f(x) between negative and positive infinity.
We will assume, for *a<x<b*, f(x) = *1/(b-a)*. Else, f(x) = 0. (This is a [[Uniform Distribution]]).
