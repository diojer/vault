Important Features:
	- It has one peak, this is the mean
	- The probability density function is symmetrical about the mean.
	- It is bell shaped
	- The random variable *x* can take any value between negative and positive infinity
	- As the random variable *x* approaches either infinity, it approaches 0
$$
x:N(\mu,\sigma^2)
$$

## Standard Normal Distribution
$$
z:N(0,1)
$$
Any *x* which is normally distributed can be converted to a standard normal. To do so, we use the following formula:
$$
\begin{gathered}
z= \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} \\
\mu: \text{Mean} \\
\sigma: \text{Standard Deviation}
\end{gathered}
$$
## Normal Tables
When we convert our random variable *x* into a standard normal variable *z*, we can easily work out the area under the graph by referencing a normal table.
