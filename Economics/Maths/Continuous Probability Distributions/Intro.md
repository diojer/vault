Unlike discrete probability distributions, in continuous *x* does not have to be a positive integer.

Instead of calculating the probability of a particular value, we have to calculate the probability of a value being in a *range*.
This is because the probability of any exact value is 0.

This means that the probability, for example, that *2.1<= x <= 3.1* is actually equal to *2.1 < x < 3.1*.
