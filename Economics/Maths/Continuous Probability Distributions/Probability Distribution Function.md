This is the probability that x is less than a particular value.

It is the integral of the [[Probability Density Function]].

To calculate this we integrate the density function, from minus infinity to some value a. This calculates *prob(x<a)*.

The probability x is between negative and positive infinity is equal to 1.

E.g., we will take the f(x) given previously in the [[Probability Density Function]], which is itself a [[Uniform Distribution]].
The given F(x), the probability distribution function, is the following:
