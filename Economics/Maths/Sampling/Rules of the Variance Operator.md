Where $X_1$ and $X_2$ are random variables:
$$
Var(X_1+X_2)=Var(X_1)+Var(X_2)+2Cov(X_1,X_2)
$$
Where $X$ is a random variable and $a$ is a constant:
$$
Var(aX) = a^2Var(X)
$$
$$
Var(X+a) = Var(X)
$$
$Cov()$ is the covariance.
The covariance of two variables will be equal to zero if they are independent.

Furthermore, for any variable $a$:
$$
Var(a)=0
$$
Subsequently, for any random variable $X$ and constant $a$:
$$
Cov(X,a)=0
$$
This is because a constant does not vary, so it does not have a variance.
