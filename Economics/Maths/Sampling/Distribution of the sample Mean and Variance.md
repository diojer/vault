#maths #expected-value #variance #sampling
For any sample mean $\bar{X}$, the expected value is:
$$
E(\bar{X})=\mu
$$
For any sample mean $\bar{X}$, the variance is:
$$
Var(\bar{X})=\frac{\sigma^2}{n}
$$
We arrive at these equations by assuming that $X_i:N(\mu,\sigma^2)$, and that drawing any $X_i$ is independent of drawing $X_j$.

Using this, we know:
$$
\bar{X}:N(\mu,\frac{\sigma^2}{n})
$$
As the sample size increases, the variance of our sample mean decreases.
