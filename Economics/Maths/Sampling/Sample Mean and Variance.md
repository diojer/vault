The sample mean, $\bar{X}$, is a random variable, because if it is drawn from a different sample it will have different results. The equation is as follows:
$$
\bar{X} = \frac{X_1+X_2+...+X_n}{n}
$$
The sample variance, $S^2$:
$$
S^2 = \frac{\sum^{n}_{i=1}(X_i-\bar{X})^2}{n-1}
$$
The population variance, $\sigma^2$:
$$
\sigma^2=\frac{\sum^{n}_{i=1}(X_i-\bar{X})^2}{n}
$$
Something to remember: $\mu$ is the population mean.
