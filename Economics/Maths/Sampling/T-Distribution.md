#maths #t-distribution
The t-distribution is the distribution of a sample with a small size. A small size is typically characterised when n<25. 

The *degrees of freedom* is equal to n-1.

As the degree of freedom increases, the t-distribution approximates a normal distribution. As the degree of freedom decreases, the t-distribution gives a higher degree of freedom to extreme events, found on the edge of the normal distribution.
