An estimator is a set of rules such that we can use the sample to say something about the population.

Examples of estimators:
- The sample mean
- The smallest value in the sample
- The first value in the sample (likely not very sensible)

## Unbiased Estimators
An estimator is said to be unbiased if, on average, it gets the population mean. (Occasionally we will be interested in other population parameters).

Mathematical Definition:
$$
E(x)=\mu
$$
The expected value of the estimator, $x$, is equal to the population mean.

## Biased Estimator
On average, our estimator does not give us our population mean.
$$
E(x) \neq \mu
$$
The size of the bias is:
$$
bias = E(x)-\mu
$$
