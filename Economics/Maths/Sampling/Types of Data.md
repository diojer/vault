#maths #sampling
- Primary
Data you collect yourself. Traditionally through surveys, interviews, viewing company reports, running experiments.

**Pros:**
- You can get data on exactly what you want

**Cons:**
- It is very costly to get a large sample size
- It is harder to get a truly random sample

- Secondary
Data that has already been collected. Common sources include Google, Amazon, FaceBook, etc.
In general, this data set is very large. We are generally assuming a decent amount of reliability when dealing with secondary data.

**Key things to think about with secondary data:**
- Think about the measurement of a variable, e.g. the difference between "wage rate" or "earnings"
- Check how a variable is measured. Unemployment is a classic example of a variable whose measurement often changes
- Check when the data was created. E.g., GDP is updated fairly regularly
- Check who is sampled. E.g., England, Great Britain, or the U.K.?
- Check the sample composition. E.g., the demographic composition. Are there too many young people, for example?

**Good Practice when dealing with Secondary Data:**
- Always keep a record of the source. Since it gets updated fairly regularly, a version number could be useful.
- Keep a record of any changes made, for example getting rid of outliers.
- Keep a record of new variables created.
- Look at the data yourself and don't assume reliability

In this particular module, we're focusing on quantitative data. Qualitative data could be transformed into quantitative, by assigning numerical values to qualities.
