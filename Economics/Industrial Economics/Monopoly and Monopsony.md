# Monopoly
- One seller
## Model
- Large number of buyers but only one producer
- Consumers may have perfect information
- Complete product differentiation
- Producer aims to maximise profits
- Insurmountable barriers to entry, i.e., incontestable monopoly

Monopoly produces where MR=MC at the price given by the demand curve.
- Abnormal profits will persist in the long-run.
- The firm will operate below the minimum efficient scale
- P>AC>MC
- Monopoly will always remain even if inefficient
## Lerner Index
- In a monopoly: P>MC
So, we can use:
- $L=\frac{P-MC}{P}$
In an extreme monopoly case, this will equal 1.
Lerner index can be written:
$\frac{P-MR}{P}=\frac{1}{\epsilon}=L$

# Monopsony
- One buyer
- For example,
	- Amazon
	- NHS
	- Labour market where certain companies are the only ones in their area
- Homogenous product
- Is a monopsony in the producers market and a monopoly in the final market.
- Perfect information
- MC=MR
- Potential intermediaries face high barriers to entry
- Producers in the producer market face high barriers to exiting
- Timing: producers announce supply conditions --> monopsonist sets price.
