- A leader is a first mover into a market
With firm A as a leader, and firm B as a follower:
- A will learn and react to what B does
- B will act as if A will not react to what B does.
# Assumptions
1. A single homogenous product
2. Duopoly
3. Identical cost structures
4. Each firm chooses Q that maximises profits, considering the other firm's output
5. Firm B treats $q_{A}$ as fixed

6. Firm A has learned firm B will react to its own output.

# Stackelberg's Solution
Because firm A is aware of firm B's reaction function, they will choose their output so that they can maximise their profit level while still falling on firm B's reaction function.

This isoprofit line intersects with their profits at a monopoly level of output, given by the point $M$. This is only achievable if firm A produces at output $q_{A,M}$, because they are factoring in firm B's reaction function into their calculations.

Firm A will not respond by following their own reaction function, as they know firm B will respond and their isoprofit curve will shift upwards.
