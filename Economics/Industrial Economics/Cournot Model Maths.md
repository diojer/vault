# Assumptions Recap
- Duopoly
	- Industry supply, $Q=q_{a}+q_{b}$
- Homogenous good
- Linear demand
	- $Q=a-P$
	- $P=a-Q$ (inverse demand)
- Identical cost structures
- MC = AC
	- both equal unit cost of production, $c$.
- Profits:
	- $\pi=pq-cq$
	- $\pi=q(p-c)$
- Zero Conjectural Variation assumption
	- Expected change in production of rival due to own change in production is 0.
# Calculating Reaction Functions
We need to maximise profit subject to a constraint:
- Max $\pi_{A}=Pq_{A}-cq_{A}$
- s.t. $q_{B}=\bar{q}_{B}$

We know that P is itself a function of quantities: $P=a-Q$ where $Q=q_{A}+q_{B}$.
So, we need to substitute into the profit function we're maximising:
- Max $\pi_{A}=(a-q_{A}-q_{B})q_{A}-cq_{A}$
- s.t. $q_{B}=\bar{q}_{B}$

Next, sub in the constraint:
- Max $\pi_{A}=(a-q_{A}-\bar{q}_{B})q_{A}-cq_{A}$

Derive w.r.t. $q_{A}$ and set equal to 0 to find a maximum.
- $\delta =a-2q_{A}-\bar{q}_{B}-c=0$ (first order condition)
Rearranging to find an equation for $RF_{A}$.
- $RF_{A}: q_{A}=\frac{1}{2}(a-\bar{q}_{B}-c)$

- The point is that $\bar{q}_{B}$ is *not* a function of qA, so the line is straight.
# Finding the Equilibrium
Set both firms' reaction functions equal to each other.
