- So far, quantity has always been the decision variable.
In the Bertrand model, firms set prices to maximise profits, not quantities.
- For example, retailers tend to set a price and supply whatever quantity is demanded at that price.
# Applications
- Cournot and Bertrand are applied depending on the market:
	- Cournot
		- Very costly to change quantity, e.g., plane production
		- No spare capacity
	- Bertrand
		- Easy to accommodate changes in demand
		- Spare capacity
# Bertrand Models
## Identical products
### Assumptions
1. Duopoly
2. Single homogenous product
3. Same location/same retail park
4. Identical cost structure
5. Each firm chooses P that maximises profits considering the price of their competitors
6. Each firms treats the other firm's price as fixed
	1. "Zero conjectural variation assumption"
	2. i.e., the change in expected price of firm A with respect to firm B is 0.
