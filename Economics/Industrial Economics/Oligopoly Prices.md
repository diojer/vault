- So far, quantity has always been the decision variable.
In the Bertrand model, firms set prices to maximise profits, not quantities.
- For example, retailers tend to set a price and supply whatever quantity is demanded at that price.
# Applications
- Cournot and Bertrand are applied depending on the market:
	- Cournot
		- Very costly to change quantity, e.g., plane production
		- No spare capacity
	- Bertrand
		- Easy to accommodate changes in demand
		- Spare capacity
# Bertrand Models
## Identical products
### Assumptions
1. Duopoly
2. Single homogenous product
3. Same location/same retail park
4. Identical cost structure
5. Each firm chooses P that maximises profits considering the price of their competitors
6. Each firms treats the other firm's price as fixed
	1. "Zero conjectural variation assumption"
	2. i.e., the change in expected price of firm A with respect to firm B is 0.
### Demand and Equilibrium
Because firms are competing on price, and both know they can get more profit by undercutting rather than sharing profits, both will eventually undercut until there are no profits left, i.e., p = MC, i.e., perfect competition pricing.

For any price Pb by firm B, firm A will always choose a slightly slower price - this difference is $\epsilon$.

However, firm A will also never set a price below their marginal cost, creating a sharp drop-off at that point.
This creates an equilibrium at the marginal cost for both firms:

## Differentiated Products
### Assumptions
- Duopoly
- Slight differentiation
	- Simplest to differentiate by location, where $k$ is the unit transport cost.
	- Consequently, the cost to a consumer of buying a commodity at firm A or firm B is the price of the commodity $p$ plus $k \cdot \text{distance}$.
	- So, living closer to B will mean B's products are cheaper.
- Different prices
	- Assume $P_B > P_{A}$, so that $P_{B}=P_{A}+\epsilon$
	- Switch to A if:
		- $P_{B} > P_{A} + (k \cdot \text{distance})$, i.e.,
		- $P_{A}+\epsilon > P_{A} + (k \cdot \text{distance})$
		- Otherwise, stay loyal to B.
### Reaction Functions

Combining both reaction functions, we get:

# Drawbacks
- ZCVA:
	- Unrealistic, since firms don't realise other firms will respond to undercuts by also undercutting.
