# Perfect Competition
Perfect Competition Assumptions:
- Atomistic Competition
- Homogenous Goods
- Perfect information
- No barriers to entry
- Firms act independently
- Fixed costs are assumed to be zero
Output that delivers the lowest average cost is the minimum efficient scale.
Critique:
- Product differentiation is a common fact of the world
- Firms tend to produce at points of declining average cost
# Monopolistic Competition
Assumptions:
- Atomistic Competition
- Consumers **may have** perfect knowledge
- Firms act independently
- No barriers to entry
- Fixed costs are assumed to be zero
Firms produce below the minimum efficient scale, where MR=MC rather than where AC=MC
Critique:
- Product differentiation is only welfare enhancing up until a certain point:

While consumer surplus only increases with product differentiation, producer surplus will eventually fall and reach 0.
- It's possible that $N_{2}>N^{*}$.
