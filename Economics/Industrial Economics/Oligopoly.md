# Characteristics
- Large number of buyers but only small number of producers
- Consumers and producers *may* have perfect competition
- Products sold may be identical, or differentiated
- Firms interact
	- Firms consider decisions by competitors when maximising profits
- There are barriers to entry
## Possible models
- Cournot model
	- Each firm chooses the level of output that maximises profits on the assumption that other firms' output levels are fixed
		- For example, Airlines decide how many flights to operate in a particular route and then charge as much as demand is willing to pay.
- Bertrand model
	- Firms choose the price level that maximises their profits assuming that prices set by other firms are fixed
		- Example: retailers decide the price of products like food/toiletries, and then supply as much as is demanded at that price.
- Some cases are not straightforward
	- Example: the shops that retailers open may be an example of Cournot competition, but the items' prices may be an example of Bertrand competition.
# Cournot Model
## Assumptions
- Single homogenous product
- Market duopoly
- Both firms are identical
- Each firm chooses Q to maximise profits, considering the other firms' output, but taking it as fixed.
- Zero conjectural variation assumption:
	- The change in rival firm's output due to own change in output is 0.
## Isoprofit curves
These curves each show all combinations of Qa and Qb which produce identical profits for a firm.

- These are the isoprofit curves for firm A.
- The farther from firm A's axis, the lower the profit level of each isoprofit curve. The closer to the axis, the higher the firm's profit level.
- Thus, moving from Z to Y increases profits. So, if firm A is at Z, they should increase production.
	- However, if firm A is over the isoprofit hump, increasing production will decrease profits, like moving from X to W.
	- This is because when supply is relatively low, increasing production will lower prices but also attract customers.
	- When supply is relatively high, prices are already relatively low and so lowering them further by increasing production will not attract as many new customers.
## Reaction Function
For any given output from firm B, there is a corresponding output from firm A that would maximise profit.

If all of firm A's isoprofits are laid out, the reaction function is shown as the line which connects all of the tangential points.
So, we see that as firm B produces more/less, firm A should respond by producing less/more up to the point of highest profitability.

The same is true for firm B.

- We obtain this diagram by superimposing both reaction functions
- C-N is the equilibrium solution, known as the Cournot-Nash equilibrium.
- Diagram is symmetric because we are assuming both firms have equal costs.

1. If firm B is not producing anything, firm A would produce at the bottom of the redline, as this is the peak of the lowest possible isoprofit curve.
2. This would feed into firm B's reaction function at the travel up the first green line to produce a new quantity.
3. When B produces at this new quantity, firm A feeds that into their reaction function.
4. Both firms travel along their reaction functions until the equilibrium is reached.
## Monopoly production

If both firms instead cooperated, they could both increase their profits by producing at a lower level M. However, this equilibrium is unstable, because once this M was achieved, both companies assume the rivals' output is fixed and begin producing at a level given by their reaction function.
## Weaknesses
The main problem of the C-N model is that both firms treat the other's output as fixed.
