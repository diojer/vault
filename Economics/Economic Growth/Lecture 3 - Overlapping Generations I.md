Every person lives for two periods: $t$, $t+1$.
- At period $t$, young people supply labour to earn wage $w_{t}$, consume $c_{t}$, save $S_{t}$.
- At period $t+1$, old people earn $(1+R_{t+1})S_{t}$ on their savings, consuming $c_{t+1}$.

Total output at period $t$:
- $Y_{t}=F(K_{t},A_{t},L_{t})$
	- Older generation supplies capital,
	- Younger generation supplies labour,
	- $g_{A}$ is exogenous.

Budget constraints:
- Period 1:
$$
c_{t}+S_{t}=w_{t}
$$
- Period 2:
$$
c_{t+1}=(1+R_{t+1})S_{t}
$$
- Intertemporal budget constraint:
$$
c_{t}+\frac{c_{t+1}}{1+R_{t+1}}=w_{t}
$$
No negative savings (loans) during youth.

Total utility is equal to present utility plus future utility, where future utility has been discounted by $\beta$, to account for impatience, or some other factor which will affect our relative subjective intertemporal pricing.
$$
U(c,c_{t+1})=\ln(c_{t})+\beta \ln(c_{t+1})
$$
- The interest rate will not factor into optimal consumption decisions because while a higher interest rate increases the relative cost of consumption in the present, it also decreases the opportunity cost of consuming in the present.
	- In other words, while consuming in the present is more expensive because savings will yield a higher return, the higher return yielded means less must be saved to earn the same amount in the future. These two effects cancel each other out.

We assume factors are paid their marginal products:
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
R_{t}=r_{t}&=&f'(\hat{k}_{t})=\alpha \hat{k}_{t}^{a-1} \\
w_{t}&=&f(\hat{k}_{t})-f'(\hat{k}_{t})=(1-\alpha)\hat{k}_{t}^\alpha
\end{eqnarray}
$$
- Wages are equal to the total product minus the remuneration to capital, since all product is split between labour and capital.

Because savings in period 1 affect investment in period 2, new capital formation is dependent on old capital stock (since savings in period 1 will be dependent on wages in period 1, which will be dependent on output in period 1, which depends on capital.)

# Fiscal Policy
$$
c_{t}+\frac{c_{t+1}}{1+R_{t+1}}=w_{t}-T
$$
- Where $T$ is net taxation.
- Doesn't account for gov. spending as investment.
