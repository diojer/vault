- New output equation, introducing $L_{Y}$ and $L_{A}$, i.e., labour in final goods and labour in technology research industries.
$$
Y=F(K,L_{Y},A)=K^\alpha(AL_{Y})^{1-\alpha};0,\alpha<1
$$
- Remember previous growth laws:
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
\dot{K}=sY-\delta K \\
\dot{L}=nL
\end{eqnarray}
$$
- There are different ways to model the change in $A$.
	- The simplest way is a proportion of the current number of people engaged in research:
$$
\dot{A}=\bar{\theta} L_{A}
$$
		- Where $\bar{\theta}$ is known as the "discovery rate".
	- Alternatively, the discovery rate may depend on the stock of ideas:
$$
\bar{\theta}=\theta A^\phi
$$
		- $\phi$ being greater or lesser than 0 will create increasing or decreasing returns to research.
			- If $\phi=0$ the discovery rate is independent of the current stock.
			- We normally assume $\phi<1$.
				- There are increasing returns, but they are diminishing.
	- We can also model "stepping on toes" effect.
$$
\dot{A}={\theta} A^{\phi}L_{A}^{\lambda}
$$
		- $\lambda<1$: externality for duplication of efforts.
		- Duplication might be accidental, due to coordination issues, or on purpose, such as challenges to intellectual property.

Resource Allocation
- Allocating labour between research and production takes the form of a proportion $S_{R}$.
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
L_{A}=S_{R}L \\
L_{Y} = (1-S_{R})L
\end{eqnarray}
$$

Balanced growth path
- All growth rates are constant in the long run.
- ==Try to prove page 31==
Deriving the balanced growth path of technology:
$$
g_{A}=\frac{\lambda n}{1-\phi}
$$
- Proof on Kobo lec5
# Special Case
$\phi=1;\lambda=0$.
- If we increase the ratio of labour in research and development, we generate only a short-run increase to the growth rate of technology.
