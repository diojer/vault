# Dynamic Efficiency
- In an OLG (overlapping generation model), there will be changing generations over time.
- Social welfare might be measured as the weighted sum of different generations' utility.
	- Assigned weights are arbitrary.
With logarithmic preferences and Cobb-Douglas production function, we know the optimal capital per effective worker, $\hat{k^*}$:
$$
\hat{k^*}=\left( \frac{\beta(1-a)}{(1+g_{A})+(1+n)+(1+\beta)} \right)^{1/1-\alpha}
$$
# Social Security
- Fully funded system (FFS)
	- All pension payments are fully funded, meaning that pay-outs are all a result of taxes at a prior time.
	- Pension payments are made at time $t+1$ to contributors who were taxed at time $t$.
- Unfunded social security system (USSS)
	- Pension payments are made at time $t$ and taxes are levied at time $t$.

USSSs were very popular but as population pyramids changed became more untenable.
- UK uses a hybrid system.
	- Older people in poverty receive USSS.

FFS does not affect total amount of savings or consumption, because taxed income acts as savings.
- It only affects consumption if taxes are higher than counterfactual savings.

With USSS, levied taxes do not grow with the interest rate, but with the growth rate of the population
- This is because the tax levied when young is not the same as the benefit received when old. Instead, young generations' taxes are instantly sent to older generations in the same period.
- If the number of young people grow, then you will receive more benefit than tax contributed by exactly the growth of population.
- This means that savings and social security have different rates of return, where the former is the interest rate, the latter is the growth rate of population.
	- Consequently, USSS will differ from FFS so long as the rate of interest is not equal to the rate of growth of (paying) tax contributors.
- USSS will necessarily decrease capital accumulation, as any lump-sum tax will. Savings are directly converted to consumption rather than being invested.
	- This does not necessarily decrease dynamic efficiency. If capital accumulation is above the golden level already, a USSS may help.
