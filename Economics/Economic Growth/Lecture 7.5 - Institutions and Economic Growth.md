Geography Hypothesis
- A lot of long-term growth is due to differences in geography, climate, or ecological differences.
- Time-invariant geographic variables affect prosperity perpetually.
	- This leads to a testable prediction: areas that were rich in 1500s should be relatively prosperous today.

Institutions:
- Institutions as rules and norms (North 1990). Formal and informal constraints on behaviour, or rules, ranging from taboo, customs, and traditions to constitutions and laws.
- Institutions as governance (e.g. Kaufmann et al. 1999): everything pertaining on how authority is exercised.
	- Checks and balances, government capacity,
- Institutions as organisations: public and private.

How are institutions conceptualised?
- Different ways to include it in modelling, e.g., in the aggregate production function.
