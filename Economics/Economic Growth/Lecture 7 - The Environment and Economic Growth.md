- Positive effects of growth
	- Tremendous progress made in providing urban sanitation,
	- Improving air quality in major cities, e.g., London,
	- Improvements in living standards,
- Negative effects
	- Pollution problems,
	- Lack of success with climate change,
	- Still rising population in the developing world - endemic and pandemic diseases often arising from here,
	- Degradation of ecosystems - deforestation, water pollution, loss of biodiversity.

Neo-Malthusian logic:
- Concerns of over-consumption of natural resources, environmental degradation, now climate change.
- Decoupling counter-arguments:
	- We can use technology to decouple the production process from environmental degradation.

Economic roles of the environment:
- Source of raw materials and energy,
- Limited natural resources may have drag on growth,
	- Overuse will lead to increased resource prices,
- Technological change depends on the relative scarcity of resources as it is often spurred by price increases.
- Sinkhole for unwanted by-products of economic activity,
	- Dissipates harmful air, water, and solid pollutants,
	- When the environment's ability to dissipate waste is exceeded, environmental quality falls.
		- Policy responses may equally be a drag on growth.

- Pollution increase at first, then falls, with growth.
# Non-Renewable Resources: A Model
New production function:
$$
Y=AK^\beta E^\gamma L^{1-\beta-\gamma}
$$
- The total stock of non-renewable energy is $R_{0}$
- The use of non-renewable energy is $E_{t}$
- This is analogous to the role of fixed land in the population model.

WE assume that we use $s_{E}$ of the remaining $R_{0}$ in production each period.
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{E_{t}}{R_{t}}&=&s_{E} \\
E_{t}&=&s_{E}R_{t} \\
\dot{R}&=&R_{t+1}-R_{t}=-E_{t}\\
\frac{\dot{R}}{R}&=&-\frac{E}{R}=-s_{E} \\
&&\text{Solving the differential equation:} \\
R_{t}&=&R_{0}e^{-s_{E}t}
\end{eqnarray}
$$
- ==Homework to solve the differential equation==
Growth of income per capita:
$$
g_{y}=\frac{1}{1-\beta}[g_{A}-\gamma(s_{E}+n)]
$$
Predictions
- Non-renewable resources should rise in price relative to renewable resources.
	- Basically wrong - even with goods that are traded in a competitive market, such as iron ore, their price has been decreasing in the long run.
- Why
	- Resource-augmenting technologies are developing faster than resources are being used,
	- Extraction is improving, increasing available supply even while total potential supply is decreasing.

Damaging the environment
- Damage abatement
	- Investment in clean technology,
	- The energy required to produce is reduced through investment,
- Decoupling
