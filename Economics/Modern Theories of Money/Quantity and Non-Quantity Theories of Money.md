# Wicksell's Dual-Interest-Rates analysis
There are three macro-sectors/groups:
- Entrepreneurs (investors),
- Capitalists (savers),
- Workers.

There are two interest rates:
- Bank Loan rate $r$,
- Real return on capital $\rho$

In a pure credit economy:
1. Banks loan to entrepreneurs who use the bank liabilities to pay for the inputs of production, i.e., the wages of workers.
2. Workers have their wages credited into their bank deposits, which they use in order to buy commodities from merchant capitalists/retailers. These commodities are the *real savings* of the capitalists.
	- By spending wages (bank deposits), workers transform the real savings of capitalists into money savings.
3. The merchant capitalists/retailers use their new money savings to buy commodities from entrepreneurs. The bank deposits are as such transferred to entrepreneurs. These deposits are then used to repay the entrepreneurs original loans.

Things to consider: this is a period-by-period analysis. An increase in investment at time $t$ can only increase the real savings of capitalists at time $t+1$.

Assuming the goods market is at perfect equilibrium, all commodities are sold and capitalists are left only with money savings.
- When capitalists buy from entrepreneurs, they do not spend all of their money savings, keeping some as profit. This profit is the real return of the production process.
	- The real return is thus equal to the price of the commodities minus remunerations to the entrepreneurs, banks and workers (as these are all factored into the cost).
If prices are fixed in the short-run, this means that an imbalance in $\rho=r$ will provide a profit/loss for the entrepreneurs.
- If $\rho>r$, capitalists will sell and buy the goods for the same amount of money (prices are fixed). As prices and costs are fixed, any extra return/loss must necessarily be passed to the entrepreneur. If the return has increased over the interest rate, the revenue of entrepreneurs has increased above costs.
- If $\rho<r$, the loss is passed onto the entrepreneurs - their margins are smaller as interest rates are higher relative to return on investment.
The greater or lesser margins of entrepreneurs will spur more investment and thus the hiring/firing of workers, which increases aggregate demand and thus price levels.
- Consequently, investment (wages) will rise (fall) above (below) real savings.
	- This gives us the equation: $(I-S)=u(\rho-r)$
	- And: $\pi=\Delta P /P=v(\rho-r)$
	- Inflation is a function of investment and savings, i.e., a function of the difference between the real and natural rate.

This whole thing makes no sense to me right now.
- If prices are fixed, how is any extra return being passed onto entrepreneurs? Where is the rise in the rate of return even coming from?
	- If it is only the capitalist prices which are fixed, how can they afford to pay more to the entrepreneurs?
- How is the money even being generated to earn the entrepreneurs a profit? All of the money in the system is first being borrowed by them, so how can they ever make enough to pay off their loans?
	- Are capitalists receiving interest on their monetary savings before buying from entrepreneurs? If this is the case, and assuming (for some reason) that the entrepreneurs do not incur extra interest costs while waiting, at most this would just allow them to break even.
- If capitalists make a supernormal profit after selling commodities, why do the entrepreneurs end up with it? Wouldn't competition between capitalists and entrepreneurs at the very least end up with them sharing it?
- Wicksell also assumes that prices are stationary, but then assumes they rise - maybe in the long-run?

$\rho$ is determined in the goods market, by the scarcity of capital, whereas $r$ is determined by commercial banks. Consequently, their coincidence seems to be accidental.
- What about diminishing returns to investment?


# New Consensus View
Important:
- The NCV maintains that the central bank can change the real interest rate in the *short run*. This is because, while they do only set a nominal rate, because prices and wages are sticky, changes in the nominal rate will change the real rate.

The NCV can be shown with three equations:
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
y-\bar{y}=f(\rho-r,X)\\
\dot{\pi}=g(y-\bar{y})\\
\rho-r=h(\pi-\pi^T)
\end{eqnarray}
$$
- The first equation shows an IS curve, as we know the difference between the real and natural rate shows a relationship between investment and real savings, given Wicksell's theory.
	- $X$ is a vector of exogenous variables such as government spending, tax, exports, etc.
- The second shows that inflation is a function of the output gap.
- The final equation shows a monetary policy rule, where the central bank will adjust interest rates closer to $\rho$ to achieve a stable rate of inflation.
