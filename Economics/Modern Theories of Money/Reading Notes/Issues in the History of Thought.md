# Analysing and Fighting Recession
>Claude Gnos

Gnos differentiates between New-Keynesian Economics NKE, and Post-Keynesian Economics PKE.
- According to New Keynesians, one of the most important lessons to derive from Keynes is the presence of wage and price rigidities in the economy.
	- These rigidities prevent markets from perfectly clearing.
	- These rigidities give a channel through which shocks in demand change output and employment from equilibrium values.
	- These rigidities are also explained through microfoundations.

Keynes' principle of effective demand, argues Gnos, is actually much more important than simply examining rigidities and will lead us to different conclusions.
- Effective demand in the goods market depends solely on decisions by entrepreneurs when deciding how much to produce. Due to radical uncertainty, they need to make guesses on how much effective demand there will be in the goods market.
	- However, the effective demand that there *will be* is dependant on the wages paid by entrepreneurs. Importantly, profit can only come from money incomes, as workers use wages to pay for goods at a price higher than the factor costs.
	- p. 303: "entrepreneurs, who have to decide on their scale of production, are condemned to forecast demand which will enter the equation only later on, that is after wages have been paid and goods produced".
- Finance has nothing to do with savings - banks create money *ex nihilo* when there is creditworthy demand.
- Wage flexibility does not improve employment, because lower aggregate wages imply lower incomes and consequently lower effective demand.
	- Don't low wages mean high profits?
		- Only low wages in a particular industry entail high profits - low wages in the whole economy cannot form high profits as prices would shift down due to low demand.

Why does investment have to equal savings in equilibrium?
- If employment increases, consumption increases but by a lesser amount.
	- This refutes Say's law which suggests that all new employment/output will itself stimulate new demand for those goods.
		- This is refuted because the marginal propensity to consume out of income is not 1.
- Consequently, there is then additional production without demand for it.
	- The amount of excess production is exactly that amount which workers decided to save of their income.
	- If investment is equal to savings, it will exactly stimulate demand such that any products not purchased due to savings are demanded due to investment.
- Without investment equal to savings, something else must be done to stimulate demand so that extra employment does not reduce itself as not all new product is demanded.
- Keynes' point is that this entire system does not depend on wage or price rigidities - ignoring them, we still encounter the same problems.

Why does NKE ignore this?
- NKE focuses on these wage and price rigidities.
	- If there are rigidities, it means that there is a channel through which demand can affect output and employment.
	- Without these rigidities, effects of aggregate demand in the economy are neutral and the supply side is all that matters - this is the New Consensus theory.
		- This is because Keynesian arguments are foregone without the presence of rigidities, and these rigidities are not present in the long run.
