## Glossary
- **High powered money**
	- Refers to *cash* in general. Precisely refers to cash at the "top of the pyramid", i.e., acceptable currency with which taxes can be paid.
- **Credit rationing**
	- Banks credit ration when they raise the credit worthiness bar for borrowers.
- **Repo**
	- Short for repossession. A repo is when the central bank purchases securities from the private sector. 
## Introduction
Claims which Lavoie sets out to disprove:
- Central banks cannot always accommodate the need for reserves,
	- When this happens, it leads to different kinds of liability management which will affect private sector interest rates.
- As economic activity increases, interest rate mark-ups increase due to commercial banks' liquidity preferences,
- Commercial banks cannot always accommodate credit demand, and will credit ration.
- Horizontalists/accommodationists pay too little attention to long-run interest rates,
- Horizontalists have not considered the effects of an open economy.
Essentially, the main claim that Lavoie wants to disprove is that there are reasons, not accounted for by horizontalists, as to why interest rates increase as output increases.
## The Bank of Canada
The Bank of Canada has:
- Zero reserve requirements,
- Reserves accrue interest 50bps below the base rate,
- Banks borrow cash at the base rate.

Because the debit of one bank is always the credit of another bank, the net settlement balances at the BoC are always zero, *assuming no transactions with the private sector*.
- The *gross* settlement balances will vary according to different economic conditions.

When the public sector makes a purchase, it deposits a sum into a commercial bank's account at the BoC.
- This means that the net settlement balance grows greater than zero.
- Similarly, when a commercial bank pays taxes, the net settlement balance is below zero.
The ==net settlement balance refers specifically to the financial sector==.

The BoC acts in a manner to ensure that, at the end of the day, the net settlement balances in the financial system is equal **to zero**.
To do this, the central bank will:
- Transfer government deposits between its own accounts and government deposits held at various commercial banks,
- Engage in repos to transfer high-powered money into commercial bank reserve.
*These are called defensive operations*.
## Defensive operations of the Federal Reserve
The Fed targets the interest rate, and their defensive operations consist of interest rate mechanisms.
- This is mainly done through operating the clearing house, i.e., enforcement of the channel system in the overnight market.
	- *This* is mainly done through sufficient provisions of Fed balances.
		- ==Question==: p.21 states that the "lender of last resort" role of the Fed has very little to do with maintaining the interest rate. However, how can this be true if the "sufficient provision of Fed balances" is what maintains the interest rate? I presumed that the lender of last resort function encompassed the lower bound rate in the overnight market.
## Open Market Operations
Open market operations consist of a central bank buying and selling government securities.
- While these are often thought to affect the reserve holdings of central banks, post-Keynesians argue that they have very little to do with monetary policy.
- Instead, it is posited that open-market operations are instead meant to into, or out of, the domestic monetary-financial system.
	- This suggests that open market operations are only necessary in an open economy, and are defensive operations.
## Weak Exogeneity of the Federal Funds Rate
In the USA and Eurozone, there have been fluctuations in the overnight rate beyond the target rate.
- Lavoie points out that on average the overnight rate is still met.
Some argue that this means the FFR is therefore still a function of market forces, therefore not fully exogenous as post-Keynesians say.
- Lavoie argues that even if this were the case, the market forces themselves are a function of government policy, because they are functions of an expected future base rate.

Finally, Lavoie finishes by saying that, while the Fed lacks the perfect information that the Bank of Canada has, these imperfections represent stochastic artefacts rather than systematic market influence.
- Central banks are not always accommodating to market demand. Specifically, they are not accommodating when undergoing a change in interest rate.
- Central banks are, however, always defensive.
	- Only this quality is necessary to posit that the money supply is fully endogenous. This is because defensive operations require an interest rate peg to "defend".
## Depicting the supply of high-powered money
Typical structuralist theories slope the supply of money upward "just a little".
- However, Lavoie argues that a flat curve is really the best way to represent the high-powered money supply curve.

There is a special case, where central banks do target a monetary aggregate.
- In the short-run, the money supply curve will still be perfectly elastic, but the long-run the money supply curve will slope upward.
	- Consequently, the upward-sloping LM curve is a special case.

Lavoie argues that there is no single rule for interest-setting decisions. The most we know is that is that the LM curve is perfectly flat for a month, or whatever rate-setting period the central bank operates on.
