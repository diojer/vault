# Chapter 1 ~ Money: An Alternative Story
# Chapter 2 ~ Endogenous Money: Accommodationist
## Glossary
- **High powered money**
	- Refers to *cash* in general. Precisely refers to cash at the "top of the pyramid", i.e., acceptable currency with which taxes can be paid.
- **Credit rationing**
	- Banks credit ration when they raise the credit worthiness bar for borrowers.
- **Repo**
	- Short for repossession. A repo is when the central bank purchases securities from the private sector. 
## Introduction
Claims which Lavoie sets out to disprove:
- Central banks cannot always accommodate the need for reserves,
	- When this happens, it leads to different kinds of liability management which will affect private sector interest rates.
- As economic activity increases, interest rate mark-ups increase due to commercial banks' liquidity preferences,
- Commercial banks cannot always accommodate credit demand, and will credit ration.
- Horizontalists/accommodationists pay too little attention to long-run interest rates,
- Horizontalists have not considered the effects of an open economy.
Essentially, the main claim that Lavoie wants to disprove is that there are reasons, not accounted for by horizontalists, as to why interest rates increase as output increases.
## The Bank of Canada
The Bank of Canada has:
- Zero reserve requirements,
- Reserves accrue interest 50bps below the base rate,
- Banks borrow cash at the base rate.

Because the debit of one bank is always the credit of another bank, the net settlement balances at the BoC are always zero, *assuming no transactions with the private sector*.
- The *gross* settlement balances will vary according to different economic conditions.

When the public sector makes a purchase, it deposits a sum into a commercial bank's account at the BoC.
- This means that the net settlement balance grows greater than zero.
- Similarly, when a commercial bank pays taxes, the net settlement balance is below zero.
The ==net settlement balance refers specifically to the financial sector==.

The BoC acts in a manner to ensure that, at the end of the day, the net settlement balances in the financial system is equal **to zero**.
To do this, the central bank will:
- Transfer government deposits between its own accounts and government deposits held at various commercial banks,
- Engage in repos to transfer high-powered money into commercial bank reserve.
*These are called defensive operations*.
## Defensive operations of the Federal Reserve
The Fed targets the interest rate, and their defensive operations consist of interest rate mechanisms.
- This is mainly done through operating the clearing house, i.e., enforcement of the channel system in the overnight market.
	- *This* is mainly done through sufficient provisions of Fed balances.
		- ==Question==: p.21 states that the "lender of last resort" role of the Fed has very little to do with maintaining the interest rate. However, how can this be true if the "sufficient provision of Fed balances" is what maintains the interest rate? I presumed that the lender of last resort function encompassed the lower bound rate in the overnight market.
## Open Market Operations
Open market operations consist of a central bank buying and selling government securities.
- While these are often thought to affect the reserve holdings of central banks, post-Keynesians argue that they have very little to do with monetary policy.
- Instead, it is posited that open-market operations are instead meant to into, or out of, the domestic monetary-financial system.
	- This suggests that open market operations are only necessary in an open economy, and are defensive operations.
## Weak Exogeneity of the Federal Funds Rate
In the USA and Eurozone, there have been fluctuations in the overnight rate beyond the target rate.
- Lavoie points out that on average the overnight rate is still met.
Some argue that this means the FFR is therefore still a function of market forces, therefore not fully exogenous as post-Keynesians say.
- Lavoie argues that even if this were the case, the market forces themselves are a function of government policy, because they are functions of an expected future base rate.

Finally, Lavoie finishes by saying that, while the Fed lacks the perfect information that the Bank of Canada has, these imperfections represent stochastic artefacts rather than systematic market influence.
- Central banks are not always accommodating to market demand. Specifically, they are not accommodating when undergoing a change in interest rate.
- Central banks are, however, always defensive.
	- Only this quality is necessary to posit that the money supply is fully endogenous. This is because defensive operations require an interest rate peg to "defend".
## Depicting the supply of high-powered money
Typical structuralist theories slope the supply of money upward "just a little".
- However, Lavoie argues that a flat curve is really the best way to represent the high-powered money supply curve.

There is a special case, where central banks do target a monetary aggregate.
- In the short-run, the money supply curve will still be perfectly elastic, but the long-run the money supply curve will slope upward.
	- Consequently, the upward-sloping LM curve is a special case.

Lavoie argues that there is no single rule for interest-setting decisions. The most we know is that is that the LM curve is perfectly flat for a month, or whatever rate-setting period the central bank operates on.
# Chapter 10: Minsky on Financial Instability
>Elisabetta De Antoni
## Introduction
Minsky believed that the New Keynesian Neoclassical synthesis abandoned the most important aspect of Keynes' General Theory, namely, uncertainty.
- Uncertainty is critical to understanding financial markets and expected returns.
- To this end, Minsky focused on financial relations in the economy, investments under uncertainty and on instability.
## Debt and Profits
Minsky's main problem with the neoclassical synthesis is that it neglects financial relationships.
- Theorems about a non-financial abstract economy are extrapolated to be valid about an economy with complex financial relationships. This "logical jump is an act of faith".
For Minsky, large, expensive, debt-financed long-term investments are presupposed.
- Investments generate profits greater than debt commitments is the underlying assumption.
	- Due to uncertainty, this cannot always be the case.
	- Markets are also expected to clear.

There are three assumptions Minsky rejected:
1. The dichotomy between the monetary/nominal and real sectors.
	- These sectors are necessarily linked because production relies on the monetary sector.
2. The efficacy of the price mechanism.
	- Patinkin (1956) is one of the most important faces of the neoclassical synthesis. According to him, a fall in unemployment is self correcting: the fall in wages reduces prices, increasing *real* money balances, stimulating consumption and moving the system back toward full employment.
	- Minsky argues that, in a world with finance, deflation will also increase the real value of debts which could depress aggregate demand.
		- As well as this, deflation will cause a fall in profits, harming the ability of firms to make good on debt obligations.
	- Consequently, this fall in price may exacerbate unemployment rather than alleviate it.
3. Financial stability cannot be taken for granted as it is in the neoclassical synthesis.
	- The market does not assure that in the monetary circuit enough money will return to firms to allow the fulfilment of prior debt obligations.
## Financial Units
There are: hedge and speculative units. Speculative units can be further split into either normal or Ponzi units.

In the case of a hedge unit, creditors and lenders foresee that expected cash receipts are more than enough to meet all future debt commitments.
- Think of a loan needed to open a retailer in an underserved area, where we expect that future sales will raise enough profit to pay off both the loan and interest.

In a normal speculative unit, future expected cash receipts are only enough to pay off the interest payments on a loan. However, if there is a boost to aggregate demand (a bonanza), then the loan could be paid off.
- Think of taking a loan to open a gambling store in an underserved area. At first, not many people come because no one is very exposed to gambling, but as more people come they bring others who tend to raise the general popularity of the store beyond its initial aggregate demand.
	- At the beginning, proceeds can only cover part of the debt obligations (interest payments). However, we could reasonably expect that in the future there will be a bonanza.
- In simpler terms, speculators expect most of their profits to come at the tail-end of investment

In a Ponzi speculative unit, future expected cash receipts are not enough to pay off either the interest or the loan - only a bonanza will allow the debt to shrink over time. If there is no bonanza, debt grows.

Speculators (both Ponzi and normal) need credit in the short-term. Without credit, a normal speculative unit cannot roll over her debts, and a Ponzi unit cannot continue to indebt herself waiting for the bonanza.
- On the other hand, hedge units are not susceptible to changes in the financial reality, only in the goods market (also termed the real sector).

Economies are more robust when dominated by hedge units and more fragile when dominated by speculative units.
- The problem is that a robust economy where profits regularly exceed expected profits will encourage speculative investment.
- Because governments, firms, and financial institutions tend to finance long-term investment with short-term debt, they are classified as speculative units.
	- All governments around the world are dependent on finance - almost no government is hedged.
## The Financial Theory of Investment
Minsky rejects the concept of equilibrium, as constantly changing expectations mean that any hypothetical equilibrium would be constantly changing, and that any alignment with the equilibrium would then be purely coincidental and instantaneous.

Instability arises because periods of solid growth and investment lead to an overestimation of future profits, too much speculative investment and a contraction of credit when future profit expectations decrease.

The basic characteristic of an economy is the existence of two prices:
1. The price of capital assets,
2. The price of current production.
Because investment involves purchasing capital assets in order to produce, it occurs when these two prices are aligned.
- The demand price of a capital asset, i.e., how much an investor is willing to pay for an asset, is a function of the potential returns on that asset.
- The supply price of a capital asset, i.e., how much a producer is willing to sell an asset for, is a function of its marginal cost.
	- This marginal cost includes in any interest payments on finance and mark-up *in the production process*.
### Modelling Investment
![[Pasted image 20241208002608.png]]
This diagram shows:
- The supply price of capital, $P_{i}$,
- The demand price of capital, $Pk$
	- The demand price is equal to the potential future returns $PV(\Pi_{e})$,
- Internal funding available to be spent on investment $Q_{i}$
	- $Q_{i}$ gives a schedule of how much internal investment can be raised depending on the supply price of capital. As the difference increases the availability of funds grows. 
- The level of investment possible with internal funding $I_{i}$,
- The maximum amount of desirable funding $I_{n}$.
Currently the diagram does not factor in credit.

When we factor in credit, we modify the $Pk$ and $P_{i}$ lines.
- The purchase price of capital must now factor in interest payments. As the *lender's* (bank's) risk increase, the interest rate rises.
- The expected value of the investment $PV(\Pi_{e})$ must now also factor in the *borrower's* (firm's) risk, because leveraging investment means the firm now stands to lose more if expectations are not met.
	- This can also be thought of in a different way: firms need a greater margin to accept higher levels of risk, and so their offering price is disconnected from the true expected return, creating a margin.
This modifies the diagram:
![[Pasted image 20241208004612.png]]
Where:
- $Br$ is the borrower's risk,
- $Lr$ is the lender's risk,
- $P_{i}'$ is the new effective demand price (discounting for risk from borrowing),
- $Pk'$ is the new effective supply price (accounting for cost of interest).
- $Ie$ is the effective level of investment, where $Ie$ is self-financed and debt-financed investment combined.
The lines curve as more finance will increase risk.
- The degree to which these lines curves indicate the margins of safety, or feeling of risk, in an economy.

### Modelling a change in the rate of interest
According to Minsky (1986, p. 195), the "long-term rate of interest is used to actualise expected profits" p. 159.
- ==What exactly does this mean?==
	- Maybe it means that a higher interest rate means future expected profits have a higher opportunity cost due to a higher savings rate.
The short-term interest rate represents a present cost of production.

Synthesising these two changes, we get a fall in the demand-price and a rise in the supply-price.
![[Pasted image 20241208010536.png]]
- Consequently, Minsky's theory affirms the existing consensus that higher interest rates lower investment.
	- De Antoni states that the novelty is that this relationship tends to stay in the background of Minsky's analysis.

### Modelling multiple time periods
Following an unexpected increase in realised profits, various curves shift.

First, more internal funding is available due to greater cashflow, shifting $Q_{i}$ outward.
- Second, future profit expectation increases to account for this unexpected "bonanza",
- The margins of safety, i.e., borrower's and lender's perception of risk, are loosened,
![[Pasted image 20241208011520.png]]
- Implicitly, firms must have adaptive expectations, i.e., they must assume that this increase in profits is permanent.
	- Cashflow from investment is also not fully self-financing.

Consequently, economic growth leads to a more fragile, i.e., leveraged, economy.

Is the idea that investment is not self-financing, and that firms have adaptive expectations, fully convincing?
### The Deviation-Amplifying Process
The interdependence of profit and investment is what leads to a positive feedback loop underlying the financial instability hypothesis.

Remembering that $Y=C+I+G$, an initial increase in investment increases incomes, which are in part the profits of firms.
- These increased profits have three effects:
	1. Increases expected profits when investments are still underway, increasing expected internal funds $Q_{i}^e$
	2. It raises profits post-investment increasing the price willing to be paid for capital assets ($Pk$)
	3. It raises confidence in fulfilling future debt commitments, decreasing the margins of safety.
		- A decrease in the margin of safety also eases the liquidity preference of individuals, as money is typically used as a store of value in times of uncertainty. In other words, the demand for deposits is reduced.
- These three effect a further rise in investment which is composed of self-financed and debt-financed investment, bringing us back to the beginning.
	- The increase in indebtedness increases the supply of credit.
![[Pasted image 20241208020446.png]]

### The Financial Instability Hypothesis
The financial origin of fluctuation comes directly from Keynes.
- Neoclassical synthesis of New Keynesianism tends to focus more on rigidities, like wage and price stickiness.
	- Minsky traces his theory based on Keynes' direct reply to this interpretation (essentially rebuking it).

An economic boom has two drawbacks:
- Inflation or financial bottlenecks leading to a higher interest rate,
- Decreasing margins of safety and transitions into speculative and ultraspeculative units.
The greater interest rate, due to how leveraged companies have become in the boom, not only ends the boom but triggers a downward spiral.
- An unexpected increase in the cost of credit comes after the unexpected fall in profits.
	- However, the fall in profits means firms need more credit if they are speculating on capital assets (they need to either roll over their debt or simply borrow more).
- The main priority of the firm becomes to pay off debt rather than finance investment.
	- Assets must be sold (which at this point are likely illiquid) and consequently asset prices fall, meaning more assets must be sold.
	- Falling capital asset prices reinforces the fall of investment
		- ==Wouldn't this be classified as falling capital supply prices - wouldn't aggregate demand for goods need to decrease for the projected value to fall (which would then harm investment)?==
- Debt repayment becomes impossible due to lower profits and asset prices.
	- The consequence is many bankruptcies.
Hedge units, however, survive - tranquillity will return as stable profits are made without the need for financial stability.
### Solutions
- The central banks need to reaffirm their position as lenders of last resort,
	- This can decrease the risk that banks feel when lending to firms.
	- Changing the interest rate doesn't do much when expectations are too low.
- Fiscal policy should have the task of promoting full employment and stabilising the economy.
	- Underpin demand to achieve full employment,
	- Implement fiscal stabilisers.

According to Minsky, the most significant economic event since WWII is actually the absence of a long-lasting, deep depression.
- He attributes this to the lender of last resort status of central banks and the presence of "big government".

### Applications
Economists from the Levy Institute focus on the financial imbalances of the US. The private sector is heavily indebted (2004) and there are large government deficits. The maintenance of satisfactory growth in the medium term will apparently require devaluation of the dollar, which could send a deflationary shock to the rest of the world as US consumption of imports falls.

Sawyer (2001) criticises the Eurozone. A Minskyian analysis would suggest different policies in the Eurozone. The primary task of the ECB should've been financial, rather than price, stability.
- The ECB would use the lender-of-last-resort to control debt deflations,
- Fiscal policy should've been recognised as the necessary element to support employment, possibly instituted through a European federal budget.
	- Instead, national budgets have been constrained.

In the open economy, debt used to finance foreign investments further increases fragility as speculators are now subject to exchange rate fluctuations.
- They could suffer from a domestic crisis that impacts their external investments,
- They could suffer from an external crisis that impacts their domestic financial environment,
The IMF mistook the Asian financial crisis for a traditional balance of payments crisis.
- It required a reduction in gov. spending and tighter monetary policy.
	- This reduced aggregate demand and led to the Minsky debt-deflation spiral described earlier.

### Notes and thoughts
- In figure 10.4 RHS, case *b* can actually be used to demonstrate the financing of a ponzi unit.
	- All investment thus far is concerned with short-term expected profits being higher than the cost of a capital asset. However, introducing speculative units could introduce some new variety in modelling.
- Is it true that an increase in the rate of interest would reduce profit expectations - the rate of interest is set, according to Wicksellian theory, in such a way as to align itself with the rate of return in an economy (which in this model firms are projecting into the future due to adaptive expectations).
- Could a opportunistic and flexible central bank be a suggestion to quell financial instability?
