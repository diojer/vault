# Introduction
Popular mainstream consensus is that monetary theory should be resigned to monetary history.
The paper is focused on evaluating insights post-GFC.

Endogenous money views have been regaining popularity at the expense of the classical theory of exogenous money.
- Reminder: exogenous money states that the central bank can control the money supply via reserve requirements (financial regulation in general) and by controlling how many reserves are given to banks due to the money multiplier.
- Exogenous money classically took the form of the loanable funds theory.
	- The market interest rate is determined by the intersection between the demand for money and the supply of money in a bank (savings and loans).
	- It is the "loanable funds" theory because the only loanable funds are those which have already been saved. The interest rate is the price needed to clear the market of these loanable funds.

Section 2 compares endogenous and exogenous money theory.
3 deals with mainstream theory and the ==policy-making approach== to endogenous money; the main features and limitations of the instrumentalist (or pragmatic) approach are discussed.
4 deals with non-mainstream approaches to the endogenous money theory (EMT).
5 concludes.

# Endogenous vs. Exogenous Money Supply
The quantity theory of money is one of the main pillars of neoclassical economics.
- It argues that inflation is a purely monetary phenomenon. $PY=MV$, where $Y$ and $V$ are held constant; $P\bar{Y}=M\bar{V}$.

The authors argue that neoclassical theory had friction with the real experiences of practitioners and central bankers, who had to predict and deal with inflation in reality.
- Dissenting academics include the Cambridge School (members of the Circus) and the pioneers of monetary circuit theory (French and Italian tradition)

At this point, the New Consensus model (NCM) has largely replaced older Neoclassical quantitative models and the Monetarist tool of money supply targeting.
- According to the NCM, monetary policy can affect the real economy in the short run, but only affect nominal factors, i.e., price level, in the long-run.
	- This is one of the key components that makes the New Consensus Keynesian in nature (specifically New Keynesian).
- The main tool of central banks is the ==interest rate==.
- Because of the wage and price rigidity (coming from New Keynesian theory), the central bank changing the nominal rate can impact the real rate.
- In essence, the central bank fine-tunes the interest rate such that it is equal to r*, the natural rate of interest. Consequently, the money supply is simply a residual, and consequently *not* the principal determinant of inflation.
