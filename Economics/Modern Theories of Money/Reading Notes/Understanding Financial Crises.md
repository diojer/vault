# Chapter 3:
- "It is a truism that banks have liquid liabilities and illiquid assets". p.59
	- Remembering Minsky, it is also true that firms have certain debt commitments and uncertain revenue expectations. In other words, certain costs and uncertain revenue (QED uncertain profits).
	- From a circuitist/stock-flow consistent approach all firm liabilities are bank/consumer assets, and all bank liabilities are firm/consumer assets.
		- Putting these two concepts together, this means that while bank assets are illiquid, they are certain in the sense that they are contractually prearranged.
		- Meanwhile, while bank liabilities are liquid, they are uncertain, in the sense that for any distinguished bank the exact amount of liabilities they will own in the future is uncertain.
		- However, at the aggregate/macro/circuit level, does this hold? The total sum of bank liabilities is only uncertain insofar as we imagine that banks create money in the future. For the current production process, however, bank liabilities are certain in the sense that they are fixed. Bank assets are on the other hand uncertain due to possibilities of default as a result of financial fragility (despite the commitment to pay).
- Gorton (1998) found evidence that bank runs are highly correlated with fluctuations in the business cycle.
	- This suggests that financial crises are endogenous to the business cycle, supporting Minsky's view, rather than exogenously caused by random panics, i.e., "sunspots".
# Chapter 4
- "Limited participation by itself does not explain excess volatility. By definition, a market is *liquid* if it can absorb liquidity trades without large changes in price. ==For asset-price volatility, what is needed is market illiquidity.== In our model, the liquidity of the market does not depend on the number of traders \[...] we assume that the market is always 'thick'. \[...] ==Instead, liquidity depends on the amount of cash held by the market participants: this is the amount of cash that is available at short notice to buy stocks from liquidity traders, investors who have experienced a sudden need for liquidity. If there is a lot of 'cash in the market', liquidity trades are easily absorbed and have little effect on prices. If there is very little cash in the market, on the other hand, relatively small shocks can have a large effect on prices.==" p. 102
- In equilibrium, the price of a risky asset is equal to the lesser of two amounts.
	- The first is the standard discounted value of future dividends.
	- The second is the cash-in-the-market price, i.e., the price when there is a liquidity shortage.
		- More precisely, the asset price is equal to the ratio of available liquidity in the market to the amount of the asset supplied.
		- Assets will be under-priced and returns will be excessive compared to an efficient market hypothesis.
	- The greater the level of liquidity preference, the greater the amount of short (or "liquid") assets held in portfolios. The greater the level of liquidity, the greater the market's ability to absorb liquidity trades (disposals in my own language) without large price changes.
		- This is a key info-dump when thinking about Minsky's theory and debt deflation.

First model: full participation
1. The short asset is represented by a storage technology.
2. The long asset is represented by a productive investment.
3. Time $t$ spans $t=0,1,2.$
	- The long asset can only be invested into at time $0$ and will return R at time 2.
	- The short asset can be invested in time $0,1$ and will return 1 and times $1,2$ respectively.
		- It is the numeraire good, i.e., represents liquidity or cash.
Returns for both assets are assumed to be certain (see Allen and Gale 1994 for uncertain returns).

Each consumer learns at $t=1$ whether they are an **early consumer** or a **late consumer.**
- Early consumers will maximise utility when liquidating all assets and consuming when $t=1$.
- Late consumers will max. utility by consuming only when $t=2$.
- This creates demand for liquidity: early consumers will want to exchange their long assets for liquid, i.e., short assets when $t=1$.

There are two states of nature: $H$ or "high", and $L$ or "low".
- In $H$, the proportion of early consumers is greater than in $L$.

Depending on the state of nature, the price of the long asset will change ($P_{H}$ or $P_{L}$) as there will be varying supply and demand.
- This represents random liquidity needs in the market changing the price of assets.

**Market Clearing when $t=1$**
1. Early consumers will inelastically supply all holdings of the long-asset.
	- $S=\lambda(1-y)$
		- Where $\lambda$ is the proportion of early consumers,
		- $y$ is the proportion of short-assets bought when $t=0$.
2. Demand for the long-asset is trickier to compute - it comes from late consumers:
	1. If $\frac{R}{P}<1$ the return on the long-asset ($\frac{R}{P}$) is less than the price of a short-asset (1). This means that all late consumers will prefer to buy the short-asset to the long-asset and demand will be 0.
		- Where $P$ is the price of the long-asset.
	2. If $R=P$, then $\frac{R}{P}=1$, and late consumers will be indifferent between holding the short- and long-assets.
	3. If $\frac{R}{P}>1$, then the long-asset will be preferred to the short-asset as its returns are greater.
		- In this case, we will have cash-in-market pricing - this is because the long-asset must be bought with short-assets (as they represent liquidity) but late-consumers only have $(1-\lambda)y$ in cash. Demand for the long-asset will be $D=(1-\lambda)y \div P$.
		- We don't encounter cash-in-market pricing in other periods because demand for the long-asset is either non-existent or indifferent.

"If the probability of being an early consumer is small in both states \[$H$ and $L$], we should expect that the consumers will tend to invest much more in the long asset and very little in the short asset. This raises the possibility that even very small changes in liquidity demand $\lambda_{H}-\lambda_{L}$ can have a large effect on prices." p. 114
- ==Link with Minsky - euphoria may lead to reduced expectations for liquidity preference. Then, even a small change in liquidity demand will vary prices greatly and can lead to the long-run rate of return on an asset dipping below the short-run rate of return and consequently leading to financial fragility (reliance on the financial sector for sustainability).==
