# Ch. 9: Financial Innovation, Deregulation and Minsky Cycles
>Peter Skott

Skott lays out a model which is concerned mainly with the link between corporate finance and instability.

One important reflection from the text is that innovation is not simply the result of an optimisation solution to existing exogenous constraints. Instead:
- "Technical change within any one sector of the economy \[...] involves the realization that practices within the sector, which were previously thought optimal, should be changed; that in fact it would have been beneficial to have carried out the changes earlier." p. 258.
What results from this is this fact:
- Some attribute to Minsky's hypothesis that it depends on the irrationality of human beings to not learn from past mistakes, and that this may be unreasonable.
	- Skott's point is that knowledge about past mistakes may not help much at all with present situations. Past crises will have led to changes in the institutional environment ("exogenous constraints"). As a result, innovations will have emerged, and previously risky actions will now be safe, whereas previously safe actions will now be risky.
		- For a real-life example: changes in the regulatory environment led to the proliferation of mutual funds, finance companies and other "non-bank" banks. Deposit insurance made it safe to place deposits in shaky Saving and Lending (S&L)'s which offered high interest rates to attract savings. 
	- Skott summarises: agents who extrapolate from past experience will be "in the position of generals using the strategies of a previous war" p. 270.

It should be clear that the costs of financial instability are high, and so the costs of intervention should be accepted but the costs of no intervention should be properly understood.
- Intervention could create moral hazard problems.

The difficulties of regulation arise, to a large extent, for the same reasons that makes regulation desirable:
- There is pervasive uncertainty. This leads to adaptive expectations from lenders which causes them to try to innovate out of existing regulations to lend more and ration less.

There may be benefits to increased fragility.
- Skott quotes a recent IMF report:
	- "\[a]s financial systems have become more competitive, more securitized, and more liquid, they have become more efficient. At the same time, such financial systems may be more susceptible to liquidity strains and crises than are less liquid, more bank-intermediated financial structures" (Goldstein *et al.*, 1992)
- Skott says we should not be too quick to accept that the market is necessarily more efficient or discount the positive effects of stability.
## Reflections
- There is a sharp conflict between generalist and specific theories. Minsky's theory tries to abstract from institutional design specific to each given boom and bust to make a more general case that there is something intrinsic to all. Doing otherwise could be construed as "missing the forest for the trees" - being too caught up in individual detail you miss the wider trend.
	- Are there theories that suggest there is no wider trend, and that consequently there is no "forest"?
