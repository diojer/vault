# Ch. 12: Debt, Aggregate Demand and the Business Cycle
Palley sets up many systems of equations to model the effects of debt-induced aggregate demand on the business cycle.
- He derives conditions which will lead to stability, i.e., a schedule of debt-to-income ratios to interest rates below which there will be no financial instability, and consequently any combination outside will lead to instability.
	- He does this while including the important Minskyian contribution that increased income leads to increasing leverage as optimism grows.
	- He then includes a correction term which slows down the accumulation of debt in response to increased incomes, which has a stabilising effect (increases in debt are not always instant).

The main point is that there are two main channels which affect aggregate demand, the stock and flow channels.
- The whole debt stock decreases AD through interest payments going from households with high MPC to households with a low MPC.
- The debt flow from households with low MPC to those with high MPC increases aggregate demand.
Flow and stock increase during times of "tranquillity" but neither flow ceases when there is a downturn in AD and consequently we are only left with stock which causes AD to further fall.

## Notes from the Author
- Minsky does not factor in consumer spending because it was not such a widespread phenomenon during his time, but Palley argues that it can be incorporated without difficulty and with it we can more accurately model real behaviour.
- The MPC of borrowers is less than, but close to, unity.
	- Some debtors save however those who have just borrowed have an MPC of 1 (or else they would simply borrow less).
- The idea that lending reduces creditor consumption echoes loanable funds theory. Adapting this to endogenous money, banks lend without affecting the consumption of bankers. In this case the equation for creditors' consumption is redefined.
- If debt is floating-rate, then interest rates can help stabilise during a downturn because lower real rates in a recession will lower debt service burdens and stimulate aggregate demand.
	- In the real world, most loans are fixed-rate but are refinanced when interest rates drop. Consequently, loan rates ==may be sticky going up==.
- The coefficient $b_{4}$ may be identified with the degree of euphoria in the system, i.e., the degree to which extra income corresponds to an increase in leverage.
