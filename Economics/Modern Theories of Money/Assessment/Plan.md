q1: Discuss the endogenous money-led macroeconomic model and its policy implications. Illustrate your answer using relevant diagrams and equations.
- Policy implications:
	- Interest rate targeting,
	- Flexible opportunistic central bank,
		- Credit and money is non-neutral
	- When money is seen generally as debt, deflation being a negative for the economy becomes simpler to explain, as it can in fact depress aggregate demand due to debt obligations rising in real terms even as goods fall in real terms
	- Fiscal policy implications for G are more pronounced due to mark-ups being endogenously determined by risk assessment and consequently certainty of returns on investment.
	- Involuntary unemployment

q2: Discuss Minsky's Financial Instability Hypothesis about the nature and origin of financial crises in modern economics
- Adaptive vs. rational expectations
	- Should agents be forward looking, i.e., should they know that an "upcoming bonanza" signals a future rise in interest rates and thus adjust their expectations accordingly?
	- Alternatively, does the above view suffer from a compositional problem wherein individual micro-level firms may assume a bonanza but this cannot apply to the macro-level firm class?
