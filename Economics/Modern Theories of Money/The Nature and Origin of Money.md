- Where does money get its value?
	- Neoclassical - markets predate money, money is a special commodity traded in this market which makes it easier to exchange goods.
	- Post-Keynesian - money acquires value from trust, i.e., a well issued debit-credit relationship that you believe will be paid back.
		- The form of this relationship has changed over time. The key question is of credit and debit, however, not the medium of record.
		- "If you accept *this*, the government owes you." - Why would I care that the government owes me? - Because *you* owe the government.
		- When a debit-credit relationship is recognised by everyone in an area, it attains the status of money.
			- In the UK, the BoE's debit to money holders is trusted by citizens.
		- Coinage provides insurance against a risky political institution, which is prone to cry the currency. Or, a political entity could be in danger of being annexed.
# Questions
In a lot of Post-Keynesian analysis, coinage originates from royal debt payments, e.g., to mercenaries, soldiers, or state workers in general.
1. Without the tax liability existing *before* state-backed coinage was issued, why would any mercenary or soldier accept it as payment?
	1. If the tax liability *was* implemented before coinage was issued, 
2. Wouldn't it be more efficient to impose the tax on necessary agents rather than the whole society?
	- For example, rather than giving general purpose coinage, wouldn't a food token, an armour token, a weapon token, e.g., make it easier for:
		- The soldiers to be supplied,
		- Those who did not partake in activities which helped the army, to remain solvent.
3. In large stock fairs where merchants cleared debts, how would a stock stick be useful if each of them were tied to the obligations of different people, e.g., why would an English merchant trade English stocks for Spanish stocks, given that the stub-holders would be so far away and anonymous (and there would be so many stocks held from different areas) as to make debt-collection infinitely difficult?
4. If large coin values were inefficient for market transactions, surely they would be inefficient to pay soldiers with too.
5. Why does the government tax government employees?
