1. What is the difference between hedge and non-hedge units?
	- Hedge financial units will have a return on investment which is sufficient to pay off both the loan and interest taken to purchase them, so long as their value does not fall below their purchase value.
		- Debt refinancing is never assumed,
		- They have real risk, but no financial risk because if their profit expectations are not realised, they can pay off the capital interest rate.
	- Non-hedge financial units are unable to pay off both the loan and interest unless their value grows beyond their original purchase price. The first kind, speculative units, are able to pay off the interest without growing in value, but must to pay off the loan. The second kind, ponzi units, must grow in value to be able to pay off both the loan and interest; if their value does not grow, the bearer will continuously fall into more debt.
		- In the short-run, they assume they cannot pay off their debt, but in the long-run they assume a "bonanza" or increased demand which increase the productivity of their capital.
		- To finance speculative debt, assets are typically presented as collateral.
		- Non-hedge investors are free riders after a financial crisis?
1. Discuss the FIH
	- Investment creates profits. This increases the expected return on capital and thus the demand price. Profits also increases cashflow and confidence (decreasing the margins of safety). This again increases investment and indebtedness. The increased confidence decreases the liquidity preference (given that demand for money grows when instability is high) but the increased indebtedness increases the supply of money.
		- Ideally, the 
		- Minsky suggested a larger public sector to hedge against the risk of the private sector.
1. Minsky claimed to have proposed an investment theory of the business cycle and a financial theory of investment. Discuss this.
	- Investment theory of business cycle:
		- Decreasing margin of safety leads to riskier investments and eventually to ponzi investment which will fail when expectations are not met. When they fail, the margin of safety expands and demand for liquidity grows, which takes loans away from firms when they need them most.
	- Financial theory of investment:
		- The margin of safety depends on finance, i.e., on loans and the interest rate offered on them.

Discussion in class
- Before discussing hedge units, we should look at:
	- Difference between certain debt commitments and uncertain profit expectations.
