1. Loans create deposits and deposits make reserves - discuss.
	- How can deposits be created without loans? How can a consumer introduce money into a bank account without that money first being given to someone else?
	- The deposits that a bank holds give it an impetus to desire liquidity.
1. Derive the AD and AS curves in the Endogenous Money macroeconomic model from Fontana and Setterfield.

2. Discuss the hierarchy of market hypotheses in the Exogenous money IS-LM model and in the Endogenous Money macroeconomic model of Fontana and Setterfield.
	- The hierarchy of market hypotheses in the Exogenous IS-LM model is, I believe, the same as in the Endogenous IS-LM.
	- The main difference comes between the Keynesian and Classical hierarchies of markets. The Classical hierarchy places primacy in the labour market - this determines the equilibrium, long-run level of employment in the labour market. The goods market being above or below the labour market equilibrium will simply create inflation, disinflation or deflation without long-term impacts. Monetary policy is only meant to regulate the goods market.
		- In the Keynesian hierarchy, monetary policy determines aggregate demand in the economy, which interacts with aggregate supply to determine an equilibrium level of output and employment.
3. Using Fontana and Setterfield's Endogenous Money model, analyse the effects of a credit crunch, i.e., a reduction in credit availability.
