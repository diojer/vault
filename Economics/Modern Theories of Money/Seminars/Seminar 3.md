1. Difference between quantity and non-quantity theories.
	- Quantity theories of money relate inflation to the supply of money in the economy. While both theories accept the identity $MV \equiv PY$, the quantity theories of money hold output and velocity fixed in the long-run. Consequently, any increase in the money supply will increase the price level.
	- Non-quantity theories of money accept the identity, but can fix or unfix output in the long-run. While the new consensus does hold output fixed in the long run (thus supply is, in the long-run, neutral), endogenous theories don't. Both series share similarities in the fact that it is the interest rate which is related to inflation, and the money supply is simply a residual which may or may not increase depending on the interest rate (because it is subject to money demand).
		- However, an increase in the quantity of money in the non-quantity theories still leads to an increase in the price level.

1. Main transmission mechanism of monetary policy in modern macro.
	- The main transmission mechanism relies on the fact that prices and wages are sticky in the short- to medium-run. Due to wage-contract and price rigidities, central banks can influence the real rate by changing the nominal rate. If these rigidities did not exist, any change in the nominal rate would not necessarily transmit to the real rate.
	- After the real rate changes, aggregate demand is reduced, due to a reduction in consumption and investment. The decline in aggregate demand eases inflationary pressures.
		- This is the aggregate demand channel. There is also the "inflation expectations" channel.
			- When people expect prices to rise, wages and prices tend to rise to prepare for the other to increase.
			- With anchored inflation expectations, wage-price spirals can be averted.
1. Pros and cons of the different non-quantity theoretic approaches
	- The new consensus approach still relegates monetary policy to price stability and does not allow it to have any real effects.
		- The real rate cannot affect the natural rate; investments never change savings; current output never changes potential output.
		- The assumption of long-run neutrality may not be valid - Bernanke and Mihov (1998) use a VAR model to show that real GDP does not return to baseline after a monetary shock.
	- The endogenous view supports the idea of path dependency - essentially, past levels of real output may affect potential output.
		- However, with unit root hysteresis, we are left with two possible conclusions:
			- The central bank responds differently to equal shocks of opposite magnitudes, or that there is, for some reason, an asymmetric probability distribution.
				- However, this is potentially good reason to think this could be the case.

accidental recessions
inflation - bigger band which allows inflation
less chance to create accidental recessions, and by changing the interest rate less we won't move potential output too low when it's not necessary.
