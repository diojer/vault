1. Difference between quantity and non-quantity theories.
	- Quantity theories of money relate inflation to the supply of money in the economy. While both theories accept the identity $MV \equiv PY$, the quantity theories of money hold output and velocity fixed in the long-run. Consequently, any increase in the money supply will increase the price level.
	- Non-quantity theories of money accept the identity, but can fix or unfix output in the long-run. While the new consensus does hold output fixed in the long run (thus supply is, in the long-run, neutral), endogenous theories don't. Both series share similarities in the fact that it is the interest rate which is related to inflation, and the money supply is simply a residual which may or may not increase depending on the interest rate (because it is subject to money demand).
2. Main transmission mechanism of monetary policy in modern macro.
	- The main transmission mechanism relies on the fact that prices and wages are sticky in the short- to medium-run. Due to wage-contract and price rigidities, central banks can influence the real rate by changing the nominal rate. If these rigidities did not exist, any change in the nominal rate would not necessarily transmit to the real rate.
	- After the real rate changes, aggregate demand is reduced, due to a reduction in consumption and investment. The decline in aggregate demand eases inflationary pressures.
