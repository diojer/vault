Fundamental Theorems of Welfare Economics:
1. The general equilibrium of a competitive economy is Pareto efficient (under certain assumptions).
2. Any Pareto efficient allocation can be achieved as the outcome of a competitive equilibrium, after a suitable redistribution of initial endowments.

We can analyse market negotiations using welfare economics.
- Assume that one individual starts with all of good 1 and another starts with all of good 2.
- Because of the shape of indifference curves, i.e., holding 50% of one good and 50% of another good gives more utility than holding 100% of one good and 0% of another good, then moving closer toward an equal distribution will improve welfare for both individuals.
- ==If marginal rates of substitution are not equal, pareto improvements are possible==
