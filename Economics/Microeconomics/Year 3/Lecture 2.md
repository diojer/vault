Fundamental Theorems of Welfare Economics:
1. The general equilibrium of a competitive economy is Pareto efficient (under certain assumptions).
2. Any Pareto efficient allocation can be achieved as the outcome of a competitive equilibrium, after a suitable redistribution of initial endowments.
# Edgeworth box
![[Pasted image 20250413135814.png]]
Person A has a lot of good 1, little of good 2 - Person B has the opposite; little of good 1, lot of good 2. Because of their utility functions, both prefer to gain more of the other item. This preference is found in the dark-blue shaded region.
- In other words, both benefit by moving their indifference curves outward, and the dark-blue shaded region captures this fact as it highlights the region which is in front of both indifference curves that pass through point $W$.
- Point $M$ is within this region, but does not - as of yet - represent a special point, rather it represents a random point picked within the shaded region.

![[Pasted image 20250413173247.png]]
- A Pareto efficient allocation is possible at point $M$, so long as point $M$ marks the point where, if indifference curves are moved up on either side, one side will necessarily lose.
	- At $M$, if Person A receives a more useful bundle, Person B's must necessarily receive a less useful bundle, as there are limited resources and a more useful bundle for A moves directly counter to the direction of greater utility for B.
- There are multiple points within the Edgeworth box that are Pareto-efficient.
	- These form the contract curve.
	- Take, for example, the point where Person A has no goods and Person B has all goods available. For Person A to increase their utility, Person B must reduce their utility. Therefore, the position is Pareto efficient.
		- This marks a disconnect between efficiency, and "optimal distribution" or "fairness".
	- Any point along the contract curve is Pareto efficient. Any movement from off the curve on to the curve within the dark-blue shaded region (which will vary depending on the starting position) is a Pareto improvement. Any movement along the contract curve is not Pareto efficient, because someone must necessarily be made worse-off.

It is possible that prices are not set optimally, so that the relative prices of two goods, i.e., the slope of the budget line, cannot lead to a Pareto efficient outcome.
![[Pasted image 20250413173951.png]]
- In this case, agents merge their subjective preferences with relative prices to evaluate how many of each good they want to buy, and how many they want to sell.
	- Each agent begins with endowment $W$, and demands goods where their indifference curve is tangent with the budget line, as this is the maximum utility they can purchase.
		- Reminder - the budget line must pass through their endowment point, as the initial endowment in this case represents their budget constraint, i.e., income.
	- A wants to sell more of good 1 than B wants to purchase, and A wants to buy more of good 2 than B wants to sell. These prices cannot lead to an efficient outcome.
		- In a competitive market, prices would adjust to fix this. There is excess demand for good 2, and excess supply for good 1, consequently the price for good 2 increases while the price for good 1 decreases. This will rotate the budget line:

## Monopoly
In a monopoly, one agent responds to the other's price offer curve, rather than their indifference curve. A price offer curve represents the optimal consumption schedule for an agent at a given price - in other words, it represents the intersection of all possible indifference curves against with changing budget lines (where the budget line is rotating, because for a price change only one good's price must changes for relative prices to change).
![[Pasted image 20250413180107.png]]
- Given that A is aware of B's offer curve, it will choose the point on that offer curve where their utility is maximised. To draw the budget line, it must intersect that point and the endowment point (as the endowment is the only income).
- In other words, A will pick the point where their indifference curve is tangent to B's offer price curve, rather than B's indifference curve.
	- This cannot be Pareto efficient, unless B's offer price curve = B's indifference curve.
	- This happens because A is unable to price discriminate and modify prices while trading. For A to reach the Pareto-efficient area in the dark-blue shaded region, prices would have to change. This is possible with price discrimination.

==These rules only hold when utility curves are convex.==
# Production Decisions
## Production Possibilities Frontier
![[Pasted image 20250413182126.png]]
- A point along the PPF can be used to define an Edgeworth box - this is because any point along the PPF defines a total set of goods which will be equal to the initial endowments.

If we are looking at production, we are looking at ==labour and capital==. When the marginal rate of technical substitution is equal the price ratios of labour and capital, our isoquant curve is tangent to the isocost curve:
![[Pasted image 20250413184058.png]]
- The slope of the line is $\frac{P_{L}}{P_{K}}$, which can be found from the formula given.
- The marginal rate of technical substitution is the slope of the isoquant curve.
- When $MRTS=\frac{P_{L}}{P_{K}}$, output is maximised and we are consequently on the PPF rather than simply within the set of all possible production.


![[Pasted image 20250413182403.png]]
- This is the foundation for combining distribution, income, and production.
- When the MRS = MRT, we have a Pareto-efficient outcome.
	- If the MRS$\neq$MRT, it would be possible to make a Pareto improvement. This is because either production or consumption could be modified to improve utility without making anyone else worse-off.
		- For example, if $MRS_{A}=MRS_{B}=1$, and $MRT=2$, meaning that each agent is indifferent between exchanging goods $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$, and we can stop producing 1 of $x_{1}$ and instead produce and extra 2 of $x_{2}$.
			- When this is the case, utility could be improved simply by completing the available transformation and receiving $2x_{2}$ in exchange for $x_{1}$, increasing utility while making no-one worse-off.

# Utility Possibility Frontier
Combining these facts about production and consumption, we know:
- There exists a contract curve along which every distribution is Pareto-efficient given an initial endowment,
- When factoring in production decisions, the MRT slope must be parallel to the MRS slope, i.e., $MRT=MRS$, for the production to be Pareto-efficient.

Combining these facts, we arrive at the UPCs and the UPF.
- A given contract curve represents Pareto-efficient points *ignoring* production, but there is a "sweet-spot" where consumption aligns *with* production and produces an, all-things-considered, Pareto-efficient point.
- Each given contract curve is a Utility Possibilities Curve (UPC), whereas each given "sweet-spot" forms the Utility Possibilities Frontier (UPF).

# Final Conditions
- Consumption Condition:
	- $$
MRS_{x,y}^A=MRS_{x,y}^B=\frac{p_{x}}{p_{y}}
$$
		- Marginal rates of substitution are equal for all consumers and tangent to the budget line.
- Production Condition:
	- $$
MRTS_{L,K}^A=MRTS_{L,K}^B=\frac{r}{w}
$$
		- Marginal technical rates of substitution are equal for all firms and tangent to the isocost line.
- Top-level condition:
	- $$
MRT_{x,y}=MRS_{x,y}^A=MRS_{x,y}^B=\frac{p_{x}}{p_{y}}=\frac{MC_{x}}{MC_{y}}
$$
		- The marginal rate of transformation between two goods $x$ and $y$ is equal to the marginal rate substitution of all consumers for those two goods, which is equal to the price ratio between the goods, which is equal to the marginal cost ratio between the two goods.
			- In a competitive market, $p_{x}=MC_{x}$.
