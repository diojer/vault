Cost Benefit Analysis
Two possible interpretations:
1. A positive outcome of a cost-benefit analysis is defined by greater efficiency (compensation tests).
2. A positive outcome is defined by improved social welfare (social welfare tests).
# Kaldor Compensation Test
>If winners/gainers from a project can fully compensate the losers, and still be better off themselves, then the change is a potential Pareto improvement in welfare and is therefore socially desirable.

In other words:
$$
WTP_{B}<WTA_{S} \to \text{Socially desirable}
$$
Where:
- $WTP_{B}$ is the willingness to pay of the beneficiaries,
- $WTA_{S}$ is the willingness to accept of the sufferers.

Beneficiaries will be willing to pay £$x$ for the utility improvement, while sufferers will be willing to accept £$y$ for the disutility.
# Hicks Compensation Test
>If the losers cannot fully compensate the winners/gainers to forego the project, such that after the compensation all households are better off, then the project is a potential Pareto improvement in welfare and is therefore socially desirable.

In other words:
$$
WTP_{S}<WTA_{B}
$$
Where:
- $WTP_{S}$ is the willingness to pay of the sufferers,
- $WTA_{B}$ is the willingness to accept of the beneficiaries.

This tests whether the "losers" could ever give an amount £$x$ in lieu of the policy, where £$x$ is the amount the beneficiaries would be willing to accept in lieu of the policy.
- If they can, then the Hicks test fails.
# Challenging Compensation Tests
- If utility possibility frontiers (UPCs) change shape as new bundles are introduced, potential Pareto improvements may appear from a movement along the UPC, meaning that the starting position matters when considering a potential improvement.
- Some arrangements can result in intransivity.

Little developed a social welfare test to complement the compensation tests, where the policy should only be approved given that one test is passed and the new distribution is socially desirable.
- To know what is socially desirable, the Social Welfare Function is introduced.
