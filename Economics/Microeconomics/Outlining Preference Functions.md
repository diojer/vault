# The standard case
The standard case consists of a concave, or quasi-concave utility function. Typically a Cobb-Douglass Function, $U=x^\alpha y^\beta$ where $\alpha+\beta=1$.

## Quasilinear Preferences
Look like standard preferences, but are not. $U=f(x)+y$. Part of the utility function is linear, $y$, while the other part is non-linear, $f(x)$.
### Optimising
# Perfect Substitutes
A utility function with a straight slope. Typically a function where $U=x+y$. Non-perfect substitutes will take the function $U=\alpha x+\beta y$, where $\alpha,\beta \in \mathbb{R}$
## Optimising
The optimal bundle of perfect substitutes is called a *corner solution*. Since both goods are substitutable, we will spend *all of* our income on whichever is cheaper.
# Perfect Complements
Two goods are needed in conjunction to increase utility. Takes the utility function $U=max(x,y)$ for perfect complements and $U=max(\alpha x, \beta y)$ where $\alpha, \beta, \in \mathbb{R}$ for imperfect complements.
## Optimising
# Bads
The opposite of a "good" - a part of, or a whole, bundle gives negative utility. $U=\alpha x-\beta y$ where $x$ is the bad.
## Optimising
# Neutrals
A part of, or a whole, bundle gives no utility. $U(x,y)=\beta y$, where $x$ is the neutral.
