# Monotonic Transformations of Utility
A (positive) monotonic transformation is a way of transforming one set of numbers into another set of numbers in a way that preserves the order of the numbers.
A negative monotonic transformation reverses the order of the numbers.
- When a monotonic function is applied to a utility function, the same comparisons between different bundles still hold true.
- Consequently, when utility maximising, monotonic functions can be applied while still resulting in the same outcome.
# Cardinal Utility
Sometimes, the magnitude of utility is significant. Theories that take the magnitude as significant are known as cardinal utility theories.
- This is differentiated from *ordinal* utility, where the ranking between bundles is the only thing that matters.

Measuring cardinal utility can be difficult. If something has twice as much utility, are you:
- Willing to pay twice as much?
- Willing to wait in line for twice as long?
- Willing to run twice as far to receive it?
- Willing to gamble for it at twice the odds?
# Utility Functions
Not all preferences can be represented by a utility function. Preferences must be:
- Transitive,
- Complete,
## Marginal Utility and the Marginal Rate of Substitution
The marginal utility of each good is calculated by deriving a utility function with respect to that good. 
- [[Outlining Preference Functions]]
If $U=2x+y$, then $\text{Marginal Utility of x}=\frac{\delta U}{\delta x}=2$.

The Marginal Rate of Substitution is the rate at which the consumer is willing to substitute a unit of **good 2 for good 1**. Utility **remains constant**. This means that the sum of the marginal change in utility **must equal 0**.
$$
MRS=-\frac{MU_{1}}{MU_{2}}
$$
Where:
- $MU_{1}$ is the marginal utility of good 1, and
- $MU_{2}$ is the marginal utility of good 2.
