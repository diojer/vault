# Share of Output

So, whenever there is a mark-up, i.e., whenever the real wage is not equal to the marginal output (1 unit since we assume that in the production function, $Y=AN$, $A=1$), firms make supernormal profit.
When firms make profit, there is deadweight loss equal to the red triangle, since this area would be wages if $m = 0$.
## Global Energy Shocks
Blanchard models a global shock as a shock to mark-up, i.e., when global costs rise, firms raise prices to maintain their mark-up. 
However, it would be wrong to calculate the wage share from the new natural level of output. Instead, the wage share must be calculated from the current level of output, not $Y_n$, or else there is output being shared we are not accounted for.
