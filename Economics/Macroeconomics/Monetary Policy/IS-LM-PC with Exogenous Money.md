# Money supply:
$$
(\frac{M}{P})^s=\frac{\bar{M}}{P}
$$
In this situation, $M$ is exogenous. The central bank sets $M$.
# Money demand:
$$
(\frac{M}{P})^d=f(Y,r)
$$
Where:
- When $Y$ increases, the real money demand increases.
- When $r$ increases, the real money demand decreases (lower interest rates $\rightarrow$ people want to hold cash).
With this money demand equation, the shape of the LM curve changes, since the central bank is setting $M$. Rather than a perfectly elastic money supply, we have a perfectly inelastic money supply:

When government spending increases, output increases, which increases money demand. This increased money demand raises interest rates, slightly curbing the increase of output. The same happens vice-versa.

Monetary policy affects $Y$, but not $Y_n$, so it is effective (non-neutral) only in the *short run*.
