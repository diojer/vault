- Firms and customers demand bank loans to finance business activity,
- Commercial banks are businesses that make loans to *credit worthy borrowers* elastically as an interest rate *set as a mark-up over the central bank policy rate*.
- Commercial banks create money when they deposit a new loan in a customer's bank account,
- Commercial banks hold a proportion of their deposits as monetary reserves at the central bank, they have this reserve to accommodate liquidity needs of customers.
- The central bank supplies monetary reserves elastically to the banking system at its policy interest rate. They do this by providing "high-powered money" (base money), which is endogenously determined.
