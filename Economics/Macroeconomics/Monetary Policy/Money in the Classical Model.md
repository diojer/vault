$$
MV=PY
$$
Where:
- $M$ is the stock of money,
- $V$ is the velocity of circulation, we're assuming to be constant.
- $P$ is the price level,
- $Y$ is the output level, we're assuming to be determined by the labour market equilibrium.
We're assuming $V=\bar{v}$ and $Y=\bar{y}$:
$$
M\bar{v}=P\bar{y}
$$
Where:
- $\bar{v}=1$.
# Finding $\bar{y}$

$\bar{y}$ is unaffected by $M$, in the simple classical model, meaning that monetary policy has no effect on the economy.
