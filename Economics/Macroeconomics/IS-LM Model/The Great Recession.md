The high cost of borrowing, low stock prices and lower consumer confidence combined to decrease demand for goods. A combination of government policy was used to address this:
- A rise in the deposit insurance threshold (government insured your bank deposits)
- Widespread liquidity in the financial system (Quantitative Easing)
- Intervention to remove toxic assets (Helps to reduce risk premium)
- Capital injections into banks (Banks were too leveraged)
- A rapid decline in central bank interest rates
- Fiscal stimulus packages - lower taxes to increase consumption, and increased gov. spending

Many of these actions are taken in order to reduce the **risk premium**, which was a massive factor in the recession.
