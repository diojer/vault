Our IS-LM model assumes a central bank sets the interest rate in the economy. In reality, there are many different types of financial intermediaries.

Financial Intermediaries develop expertise about **specific** borrowers and tailor lending to these special needs. They borrow and lend at rates above those set by the central bank, in order to turn a profit. However, the 2008 crisis showed how this may go wrong.

- **Capital** can be thought of as an initial cash injection from the owners.
- **Bank Liabilities** may be demand deposits, interest paying deposits, or borrowing from other investors or banks.
- **Bank Assets** may be reserves, any sort of loans (i.e. to consumers, firms, or other banks), mortgages, government bonds, or any other sort of securities.

These form an individual's, or firm's, balance sheet. Your assets should equal your liabilities plus capital.

#### The Capital Ratio
The capital ratio is the ratio of a bank's capital to its assets, capital/assets.
A very low capital ratio could be an indication of a future liquidity problem, i.e., a problem ensuring all assets can be quickly liquidated to cover liabilities.

#### The Leverage Ratio
The leverage ratio is the inverse of the capital ratio, it is assets/capital. It is more traditional to focus on the leverage ratio. A high leverage ratio will present the same indication of a liquidity problem as a low capital ratio.
