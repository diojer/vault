We can extend the IS-LM model from [[The IS-LM Model]] by including the *real interest rate* and the *risk premium*. Before this, we were assuming that prices were fixed, and thus inflation was 0. 

If prices are fixed then [[Economics/Macroeconomics/Formula Sheet#Inflation|inflation]] will be zero. Thus, nominal and real interest rates are equivalent in the short run:
$$
r_t=i_t
$$
However, in the long run, real interest rates are the following:
$$
\begin{gather}
r_t = i_t-\pi^e_{t+1} \\
\pi^e_{t+1} ~\text{is the expected inflation rate in the future}
\end{gather}
$$

## IS Relation
We will derive the following IS relationship:
$$
Y = C_0 + C_1(Y-T)+I(Y, r+x)+G
$$
$$
r ~\text{is the real interest rate}
$$
$$
x ~\text{is the risk premium}
$$
A rise in the risk premium will cause a fall in investment.

## LM Relation
The LM relation is similar to before, but now it is a function of real interest rates, not nominal interest rates:
$$
r = \bar{r}
$$
## Zero Lower Bound
If nominal interest rates are zero, then people are indifferent between holding money and holding bonds. 
If the nominal interest rate is zero, however, we can use our formula for the real interest rate:
$$
r_t = 0 - \pi^e
$$
Our real interest rate is equal to the negative of the expected inflation.

So, the lower bound of nominal interest rates is 0.
The lower bound of real interest rates is the negative of our expected inflation.

## Changes from Previous Model
The risk premium presents itself as a cost to firms wanting to invest. Therefore, the real rate of interest for investors is r+x.
Essentially, the important part to take away from these changes is that investment and the IS relation can change, without the LM relation changing, due to a change in the risk premium of investment.

Before, a change in interest would change both IS and LM. Now, a change in risk premium changes only IS.
