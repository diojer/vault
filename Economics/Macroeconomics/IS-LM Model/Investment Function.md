Currently, in the Keynesian Cross model, there is no link between demand in the economy and financial/investment markets.

The most important variable when assessing financial markets is the interest rate (i).

Introducing an investment function, aggregate demand in an economy is now:
$$
AD = C(Y,T) + I(Y,i) + G
$$
This means that *I* is now a function of the level of employment *Y*, and the interest rate *i*.

The function:
$$
\begin{gather}
I = b_0 + b_1Y + b_2i \\
\text{Where } b_0 \text{ is the autonomous level of investment,} \\
b_1 \text{ is the sensitivity of I to Y (marginal propensity to consume), and} \\
b_2 \text{ is the sensitivity of I to i.}
\end{gather}
$$
With the addition of the investment function, equilibrium output now becomes:
$$
Y = \frac{1}{1-C_1-b_1}*(C_0-C_1T+b_0-b_2i)+G
$$
Consequently, our Keynesian Cross changed to become the following:

We assume that $0 < C_1+b_1 < 1$.

Increasing the interest rates mean that invesment is lower, and our ZZ line is shifted downwards. The opposite happens if interest rates fall.
