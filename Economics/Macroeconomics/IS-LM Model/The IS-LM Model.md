## The IS Relation
When modifying interest rates, this modifies our level of output Y (according to $b_2$). We can demonstrate this relation using an IS diagram:

Increasing interest rates leads to a lower level of output, while increasing them leads to a greater level.


## Financial Markets and Demand for Money
Financial markets are an increasingly important sector of the economy.

We can simplify financial markets into two distinct assets: money and bonds.
**Money**: currency (coins, banknotes) and deposits
**Bonds**: pay a positive interest rate (i) and cannot be used for transaction purposes. We'll assume that there is only one type of bond which pays interest rate (i).
$$
\begin{gather}
M^D=f(PY,L(i)) \\
M^D ~\text{represents the demand for money} \\
PY ~\text{represents nominal money demand} \\
L ~\text{represents a liquidity function} \\
\frac{M^D}{P} = f(Y,L(i)) \\
\frac{M^D}{P} ~\text{represents real money demand}
\end{gather}
$$
There is a positive relationship between our level of real transactions, and demand for money. 
On the other hand, there is a negative relationship between interest rates and the demand for money.
This is because a higher level of interest incentivises holding bonds rather than money.

## The LM Relation
- Money is created when banks make loans to individuals, firms and government.
- The central bank sets the interest rate and supplies real money balances ($\frac{M}{P}$) perfectly elastically.

The LM relation is where:
$$
i=i_0
$$
meaning that interest rates are set to be autonomous.
Overall, the demand for money depends on output and interest rates. Therefore, the amount of money in an economy will depend on money demand.

The LM curve is perfectly horizontal due to the supply of money being perfectly elastic. Even as the demand for money changes depending on external factors, such as government spending and taxes, the corresponding points will still form the straight line, LM.

## IS and LM together

As shown in the diagrams above, the IS-LM relation determines the level of output, Y.
