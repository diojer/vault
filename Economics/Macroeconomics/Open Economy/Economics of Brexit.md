The UK has a strong surplus in the services sector but a strong deficit in the goods sector.
As a share of GDP, goods have been gradually replaced by services.
44% of UK's exports are to the EU.
## Economists FOR Brexit
We could import cheaper trade goods from the rest of the world, since we won't be hindered by EU tariffs anymore.
Cheaper imports from agriculture and manufacturing could support the service sector in the UK.
Main line of argument:
- UK consumers benefit from cheaper world imports of agricultural and manufactured goods
- These resources are made available to the UK service sector where the UK has a comparative advantage
- This raises the services output, eliminating UK manufacturing in the long-run
- Prices for consumers fall and economic welfare rises by 4%.
### Criticisms
- This assumes a fall of import costs of 10%, but the average tariff is only 3-6%
- Economists think that distance does matter in trade
- The model is based on perfect competition and homogenous goods
- The FT says, "it ignores the understanding of trade developed over the past half century while introducing very peculiar empirical assumptions".
90-95% of economics disagreed with Brexit.
Because of reduced integration with the EU, the number of firms in the market would decrease and the break-even curve would shift back, increasing mark-up and decreasing productive capacity.
# Summary
Modern economic theory suggests that the Brexit free trade deal will have a net negative impact on UK GDP, as opposed to the previous customs union and single-market membership.
There are concerns related to investment due to continuous uncertainty - every time the EU introduces a regulation, there is uncertainty on whether the UK will follow suit or not.
Data is hard to interpret due to the number of shocks that have hit global economies since 2016, such as COVID-19.
The impact of Brexit will be mitigated somewhat by net migration levels that are similar to levels before Brexit - the main difference is that almost all immigrants come from non-EU countries now, whereas before it was roughly a 50/50 split.
