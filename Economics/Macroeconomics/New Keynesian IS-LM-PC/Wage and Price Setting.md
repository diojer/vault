# Price Setting
We assume a production function for the economy with [[Economics/Macroeconomics/Classical, Two Period and RBC Model/Seminar#Constant Returns to Labour?|constant returns to labour]]:
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
Y&=&AN \\
Y_N'&=&A \\
Y_N''&=&0
\end{eqnarray}
$$
Where:
- $Y$ is real output
- $A$ is technology
- $N$ is how much labour is employed

Product markets are imperfectly competitive, so firms can set mark-up, $m$.
$$
P=\frac{(1+m)W}{A}
$$
Where:
- $P$ is the price level,
- $W$ is the wage level
We can rearrange this to express real wages:
$$
\frac{W}{P}=\frac{A}{1+m}
$$

The price setting curve is similar to the labour demand curve from the classical system
# Wage Setting
$$
W=P^eF(u,z)
$$
Where:
- $P^e$ is the expected price level,
- $u$ is the unemployment rate,
- $z$ is any factor that increases workers' bargaining power.

When $z$ increases, we have an upward shift in WS.
