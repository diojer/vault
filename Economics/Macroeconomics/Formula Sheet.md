$Y = Income$
###### [[The Goods Market#The Composition of GDP|Aggregate Demand]]
$$
\begin{gather}
AD = C+I+G+(X-IM) \\
\end{gather}
$$
$AD = Y$ [[The Goods Market#Keynesian Cross|At equilibrium]] in the Keynesian Cross model

###### [[The Goods Market#Variables|Consumption]]
$$
\begin{gather}
C = C_0 + C_1(Y-T) \\
C_0 ~\text{is autonomous consumption, which happens regardless of disposable income} \\
C_1 ~\text{is marginal propensity to consume} \\
Y-T ~\text{represents disposable income. Y is income, T is tax}
\end{gather}
$$

#### [[Investment Function|Investment]]
$$
\begin{gather}
I = b_0 + b_1Y + b_2i \\
b_0 ~\text{represents autonomous investment which will always occur in an economy} \\
b_1 ~\text{represents the marginal propensity to invest} \\
b_2 ~\text{represents the sensitivity of investment to the rate of interest}
\end{gather}
$$

#### The Multiplier
$$
\text{The Multiplier: } \frac{1}{1-C_1}
$$
Where $C_1$ is your marginal propensity to consume. 

#### Inflation
$$
\pi_t = \frac{P_t-P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}}
$$
#### Real Interest Rate
$$
\begin{gather}
r_t = i_t-\pi^e_{t+1} \\
\pi^e_{t+1} ~\text{is the expected inflation rate in the future}
\end{gather}

#### IS-LM Model
IS Relation:
$$
Y = C_0 + C_1(Y-T)+I(Y, r+x)+G
$$
$$
r ~\text{is the real interest rate}
$$
$$
x ~\text{is the risk premium}
$$
LM Relation:
$$
r = \bar{r}
$$
Money Demand:
$$
\begin{gather}
M^D=f(PY,L(i)) \\
M^D ~\text{represents the demand for money} \\
PY ~\text{represents nominal money demand} \\
L ~\text{represents a liquidity function} \\
\frac{M^D}{P} = f(Y,L(i)) \\
\frac{M^D}{P} ~\text{represents real money demand}
\end{gather}
$$ 
----
#### Wage and Price Determination
Wage setting:
$$
\begin{gather}
W=P^ef(u,z) \\
P^e ~\text{is the expected price level} \\
u ~\text{is the unemployment rate} \\
z ~\text{refers to labour bargaining power}
\end{gather}
$$

Price Setting:
$$
P=(1+m)W
$$
	Since prices are generally set by a firm's costs of production, and we are not in perfect competition, prices will be equal to wages plus a mark-up $m$ equal to supernatural profits.
