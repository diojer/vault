# Absolute Advantage
Adam Smith contends that nations should specialise into goods they are more effective at producing.
# Comparative Advantage
David Ricardo argues countries should produce goods in which they have a relative advantage.
## Assumptions
- Two countries
- Two outputs
- Static model
## Consequences
### Simple Liberalisation Model

The consumer surplus, on the other hand, now extends to the line represented as EH.
- Net gain from liberalising trade:
	- Loss in producer surplus
	- Loss in government revenue
	- Rise in consumer surplus, greater than the loss for gov. and producers.
### Heckscher-Ohlin Model - Key Takeaways
- Specialisation via factor abundance
- All countries gain through higher welfare
- International price equalisation leads to factor price equalisation (wages and interest rates)
- Potentially negative implications for domestic income distribution (abundant factor gains)
Considering the US and China:
- US imports labour-intensive goods from China (clothing, electronics)
- China imports capital-intensive goods from the US (machinery, high-tech products)
- Potentially negative incomes in the US for domestic income distribution: poorer manual labourers lose out compared to poorer Chinese labourers.
# Important things to consider
- A static gain does not necessarily mean it will remain overtime.
	- Exporting primary goods, e.g., coffee, may lead to a reduction in terms of trade - the price of labour-intensive goods will slowly decrease, meaning more of that good must be exported to maintain a desired trade balance.
- Harmonised regulation, e.g. customs union, can be more important than the level of regulation due to [[EU-UK Free Trade Agreement#Trade In Goods|non-tariff technical barriers to trade]].
- Most comparative advantage models are based on the assumption of perfect competition.
