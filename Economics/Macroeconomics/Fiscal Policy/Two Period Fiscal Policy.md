$$
C_1+\frac{C_2}{1+r}\leq Y_1+\frac{Y_2}{1+r}
$$
If we plug into the Lagrangian where $r=0$, we can deduce:
1. $\frac{1}{C_1}=\lambda$
2. $\frac{1}{C_2}=\lambda$
3. $W=C_1+C_2$
Substituting, we can find $\frac{W}{2}=C_1=C_2$.
# Public Budget Constraint
The government can now:
- Tax and spend, $T_1, T_2, G_1, G_2$,
- Have an inherited level of debt, $D_1$
- Borrow (and pay an interest rate), $r_G$,
- Choose its level of $G_1$ and $G_2$.
Assuming $D_1=0,r=r_G$,
$$
G_1+\frac{G_2}{1+r}\leq T_1+\frac{T_2}{1+r}
$$
## Ricardian Equivalence Principle
![[Pasted image 20231027132659.png]]
The equivalence principle posits that all government spending must be taken out of private wealth.
The Ricardian Equivalence Principle implies that the G. spending multiplier is 0.

## Ricardian Equivalence Problems
The equivalence fails when:
- $r_G\neq r$,
	- Citizens are happy for gov to borrow on their behalf
- Moral or new citizens
- Restrictions on borrowing
- Distortionary taxes and employment
- Evidence
