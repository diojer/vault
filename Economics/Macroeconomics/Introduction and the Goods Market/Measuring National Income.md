National income and product accounts were developed at the end of WWII to measure aggregate output.
The measure of aggregate output is called gross domestic product (GDP)
There are three ways of measuring GDP:
	The product method
		*Add up the value of all the goods and services produced in the country, industry by industry*
	The income method
		*Add up all the incomes paid to households (wages, salaries, profits, rent and interest)*
	The expenditure method
		*Add up all the expenditure necessary to purchase the nation's production (Y=C+I+G+(X-M))*
These usually give slightly different answers due to statistical reasons, but they are measuring the same thing.

When using the production method, it is important to consider only the value added. So, the cost of any materials used in production must be subtracted. Otherwise, we'll be "double counting" product.
