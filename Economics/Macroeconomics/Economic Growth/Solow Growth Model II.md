Since we're assuming a closed economy with no direct government investment, our output is the following:
$$
Y = C+I
$$
We also know that next periods capital stock depends on the current capital stock, and how much we invest in it today:
$$
K_{t+1}=(1-\delta)K_t+I_t
$$
$K_{t+1}$ is next periods capital stock
$\delta$ is the percentage of capital stock wearing down
$K_t$ is current capital stock
$I_t$ is investment

This can be rearranged to the following key equation:
$$
\frac{K_{t+1}}{AN}-\frac{K_{t}}{AN}=sf(\frac{K_{t}}{AN})-\delta(\frac{K_{t}}{AN})
$$
This equation describes the dynamics of capital per effective worker.
$\frac{K_{t+1}}{AN}-\frac{K_{t}}{AN}$ describes the change in capital
$sf(\frac{K_t}{AN})$ describes the savings
$\delta(\frac{K_t}{AN})$ describes the required investment
