As we saw previously, the equilibrium point for our model is where savings are equal to investment, in other words,
$$
sf(\frac{K_{t}}{AN})=(\delta+g_A+g_N)(\frac{K_{t}}{AN})
$$
This is also known as the steady state.
If the level of capital per worker is above or below the steady state, then the level of capital per worker will converge to this level.

If the left hand side, savings, are greater than investment, then $\frac{K}{AN}$ grows.
