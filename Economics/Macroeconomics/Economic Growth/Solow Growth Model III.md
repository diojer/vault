The stock of technology grows at a fixed rate every period:
$$
\frac{A_{t+1}-A_t}{A_t}=g_A
$$
$A$ is the stock of technology
$g_A$ is the growth of technology

The population grows at a fixed rate every period:
$$
\frac{N_{t+1}-N_t}{N_t}=g_N
$$
$N$ is the population
$g_N$ is the population growth

We can add these growths to our previous equation:
$$
\frac{K_{t+1}}{AN}-\frac{K_{t}}{AN}=sf(\frac{K_{t}}{AN})-(\delta+g_A+g_N)(\frac{K_{t}}{AN})
$$
The justification is as follows:
$\delta$ is the percentage of any new investment which replaces depreciated capital
$g_N$ - each time the population grows a percentage of investment must be used to provide capital to the new population
$g_A$ - each time there is a new technological improvement a percentage of investment must be used to implement it
