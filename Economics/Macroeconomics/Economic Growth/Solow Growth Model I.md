The model has two key equations and three key curves:
- Output
- Savings
- Required investment
We can think of the whole economy in terms of an aggregate production function:
$$
Y=f(K,AN)
$$
$Y$ is aggregate output,
$K$ is capital - the sum of all machines, plants and office buildings in the economy
$N$ is labour,
$A$ is technology,

We're assuming the production function exhibits constant returns to scale. If we double the amount of effective labour, $AN$, we double the output of the economy.

We can rearrange the formula to the following first key equation:
$$
\frac{Y}{AN}=f(\frac{K}{AN})
$$
$Y/AN$ is output per effective worker
$K/AN$ is capital per effective worker

We're assuming that, if labour is fixed, increases in capital will lead to smaller and smaller increases in output.
