# **Pre-seminar questions**
- The individual with $\rho=0.05$ values consumption today the most.
# **In-class Prep**
2. $$u(c_{t})=\frac{c_{t}^{1-\theta}}{1-\theta}$$
	- Is a representative individual's consumption function.
	- She works in both periods of her life earning $y_t$ after taxes. She has no assets and receives nor leaves inheritance.
	- (a) What is the present value of her consumption?
>The present value of her expected utility, $U(\phi_{t}^E)$, is the sum of her utility in both periods. The consumption in period one has to be upgraded according to time preference.
$$
V_{t}^E=u(c_{t})+\frac{1}{1+\rho}u(c_{t+1}^E)
$$

- (b) What is the present value of income?
>The present value of income is the sum of consumption in both periods, with the second period discounted for the rate of interest.
$$
\Psi_{t}^E=y_{t}+\frac{1}{1+r}y_{t+1}
$$

- (c) What is her budget constraint?
>The budget constraint is different for two different periods. If she spends all of her money earned in period 1, *in* period 1, then her budget constraint is simply $y_{t}+y_{t+1}$. If she saves all of her money, her budget constraint in period 2 is $(1+r)y_{t}+y_{t+1}$.
>Assuming she can borrow in period 1, her budget constraint is instead $y_{t}+y_{t+1}\cdot \frac{1}{1+r}$.
