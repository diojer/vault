$$
\frac{W}{P}=\frac{\eta-1}{\eta}\cdot MPL
$$
Where:
- $P$ denotes prices,
- $\eta$ is the absolute value of the price elasticity of demand in the goods market,
- $W$ denotes nominal wages,
- $MPL$ is the marginal product of labour.

	a) 
	$MPL=1$
		i) 
			$\eta=\infty$
			Firms are willing to pay the full marginal product of labour,
		ii)
			$\eta=10$
			Firms are willing to pay $\frac{10-1}{10}=\frac{9}{10}$ of the marginal product of labour,
		iii)
			$\eta=5$
			Firms are willing to pay $\frac{4}{5}$ of the marginal product of labour.

		Policy implications: the price elasticity of demand in the goods market should be maximised to ensure high levels of employment.
