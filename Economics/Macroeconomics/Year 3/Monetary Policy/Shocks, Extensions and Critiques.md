# Modelling a shock
![[Pasted image 20250114171259.png]]
- Inflation shock jumps economy from point A to point B:
	- Employment has stayed the same but inflation has increased.
- This pushes the Phillips Curve up. The intersection between the new PC and the MR is now point C.
- The central bank sets the interest rate to align output at point C which, via the PC, will set inflation equal to $\pi_{1}$.
- Because inflation is falling inflation expectations are reduced: PC will shift down next period and intersect MR at point D.
- CB changes interest rates to align output with point D which, through the new Phillips Curve, will set inflation to $\pi_{2}$.
- This continues until both output and inflation are back to target.
# Inflation- or Unemployment-averse
The loss function:
$$
L=(y_{1}-y_{e})^{2}+\beta(\pi_{1}-\pi^T)^{2}
$$
Indicates a preference between unemployment $y_{1}-y_{e}$ and inflation $\pi_{1}-\pi_{e}$, determined by $\beta$.
- If $\beta>1$, inflation deviating from target incurs a harsher loss than unemployment deviating from equilibrium. Central banks will be more inflation averse.
	- This flattens the isoloss curves, because a *smaller amount of inflation* is as bad as *the static comparator of unemployment*.
	- This also flattens the MR curve as the intersections between the isoloss curves and PC curves change.
# Critiques
- Ignores hysteresis,
- Fiscal policy is downgraded and full crowding out is assumed.
- No recognition of credit markets or the banking system.
- The central bank has no tool to fight **cost-push inflation** or **asset-price bubbles** other than depressing AD.
	- Macroprudential tools were introduced to deal with this.
- CB must be able to forecast inflation but suffer from large estimation errors.
- Price stability is still followed by shocks,
- The connection between inflation targeting and inflation moderation is still up for decision.
