# Lessons for Policymakers
- Financial crises may build up undetected because inflation measures don't include housing prices.
	- New indicators are needed to detect these.
- The central bank should extend its mandate to include private debt
- Interest rates alone cannot prevent asset price bubbles.
	- Macroprudential policies are needed.
		- These are characterised by stringent Loan-to-Value rules, i.e., making it harder to borrow against increases in home equity.
		- New capital or equity ratio requirements have been introduced so that banks internalise risk externalities and avoid moral hazard (bailouts).
