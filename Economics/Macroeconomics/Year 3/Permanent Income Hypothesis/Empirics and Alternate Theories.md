# Empirics
>Evidence from anticipated changes in income provides little support for the PIH.
- Using aggregate consumption data for the G7, we cannot reject the hypothesis that 50% of consumers spend according to current, rather than permanent, income.
- Households spend 20-40% of their tax rebate after it was received rather than smoothing their consumption knowing it would arrive.
- Tax relief studies find stronger effects in lower income households.
The evidence on anticipated changes to income finds **excess sensitivity** of consumption to income changes, particularly to **rising income**.
## Why some consumers don't borrow against future income
Some individuals...
- Are credit constrained,
	- Asymmetric information between individuals and banks means that young, lower-income or unemployed people are not deemed credit-worthy.
		- Risk-averse bank pay-off function,
	- Red-lining?
		- Specific sections of the population not given credit, on basis of race or gender.
	- Studies suggest between 20-67% (big margin) of consumers are credit constrained.
- Use precautionary savings to face future uncertainties.
	- When uncertainty about future income increases, savings tends to increase.
		- Uncertainty about the future often rises when unemployment rises.
		- Propensity to save increases during downturns.
	- Individuals have a liquidity-preference and gain utility from holding liquid assets.
## Unanticipated changes in income
>Evidence from unanticipated changes also provides little support for PIH.
- After WWII, veterans received an unanticipated wind-fall to their National (Service Life) Insurance.
	- This caused a large surge in consumption, rather than a modest increase over their lifetimes.
This also implies excessive sensitivity to unanticipated changes in income.
This could be because:
1. Impatient consumers
	- Consumers value current consumption more than future consumption, i.e., $\rho>r$.
		- There is strong evidence of this - some consumers don't save (or save too little) so that their paths of consumption match their income paths.
2. Consumers cannot differentiate between a temporary or a permanent income increase.
	- There is some evidence for this: permanent changes in income have a greater effect than temporary, but permanent shocks have less effect than predicted by PIH.
## Impatience
>Are we impatient?
- Experimental evidence:
	- Our consumption choices exhibit a time inconsistency:
		- We believe we *should, in the future* cut back on carbon emissions to save the planet, but do not do so now.
		- Voluntary health and pension schemes tend to lead to under-savings.
	- To prevent time-inconsistencies, governments pre-commit individuals to spending plans like health and pensions.
# Alternative Consumption Explanations
>PIH empirical problems have led to new suggestions.
1. **Pragmatic theoretical approach** - extend PIH to incorporate credit constraints and impatience, with heterogenous agents. See HANK models.
2. **Pragmatic empirical approach** - identify an empirical consumption function from models in the literature.
3. **Post-Keynesians** propose an alternative form of preferences, such as lexicographic preferences.
	- A lexicographic preference is a kind of *veto* preference, where a bundle of one good will always be preferred to some amount of a bundle of another good.
		- Could this just be modelled with bads?
4. **Behavioural models** suggest that individuals do not calculate their optimal consumption over time, instead, they:
	- Adopt rules of thumb that allow us to live with uncertainty,
	- Compare behaviours to others and judge based on this point of reference, i.e., "Keeping up with the Joneses"
## "Keeping up with the Joneses"
>This theory suggests individuals decide consumption relative to others, rather than calculating optimal consumption over time, i.e., maximising utility subject to future income expectations.
- The "others" is known as the reference group for consumption. This could be:
	- Neighbours,
	- Schoolmates,
	- Work colleagues, etc.

This approach produces a good model to explain:
1. Consumption smoothing - there is a lack of volatility in consumption because our reference point moves slowly,
2. Non-unique optimal consumption,
3. "Errors in behaviour":
	- Collective pensions under-saving - everyone consuming/saving around a reference does not mean it's an optimal level.
	- Unsustainable ecological consumption,
	- Consumption-bubbles.
