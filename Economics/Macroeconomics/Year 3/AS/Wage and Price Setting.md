# Equilibrium
>Laynard, Nickell and Jackman (1991) put together WS and PS to model unemployment under imperfect competition.
- This is called the WS-PS *a la* LNJ

- When employment is at equilibrium, the wage satisfies workers and firms.
	- At this point, nominal wages and prices grow at a constant rate, so there is constant inflation.
	- $U_{e}$ is the NAIRU
- When $N>N_{e}$ inflation rises and vice versa.
- $N_{e}$ is determined by imperfect competition.

Macro policy, like fiscal and monetary policy, cannot change NAIRU. Consequently, the only way to increase the equilibrium is to:
- Shift WS:
	- Lower benefits,
	- Lower union power,
	- Decrease the disutility of work,
	- Increase the monitoring capabilities,
- Shift PS:
	- Increase competition (lowering mark-up),
	- Reduce price-push factors (more competition in input markets),
	- More controversial:
		- Lower the cost of finance (this would link monetary policy to the labour market),
		- Increase productivity.
# The Phillips Curve and Inflation
When employment is above equilibrium:
1. Lower unemployment means workers have greater bargaining power,
2. Wages rise as a result,
3. Prices immediately rise to maintain the margin.
4. Inflation grows due to this price rise.
5. In the next period, workers will ask for a higher wage as their real wage has decreased due to inflation,
This cycle continues.
Inflation therefore grows as a result of conflict between workers and firms.

Formally, we can write the Phillips curve as a function:
$$
\pi_{t}=\pi_{t+1}^E+a(y_{t}-y_{e})
$$
Where:
- $\pi_{t+1}^E$ is the expected inflation in the next period,
- $y_{t}-y_{e}$ is the output gap
- $a$ measures the inflation sensitivity to the output gap, i.e., the slope of the Phillips curve.
	- It tends to track the slope of the WS curve. If the WS curve is steep, there will be more conflict for higher wages with higher productivity and thus higher inflation.
If we assume *adaptive expectations*:
$$
\pi_{t+1}^E=\pi_{t-1}
$$
# Using WS-PS to analyse trends
1. Since the 1980s, there was been a **clear downward trend in union membership**.
2. Recently, we have experienced the rise of the *gig economy*.
These two things have led to flattening wage growth.
- See [[Labour Productivity and Compensation Gap]] for a possibly better understanding.
Lecture suggests that financialisation has also led to wages being further squeezed.
