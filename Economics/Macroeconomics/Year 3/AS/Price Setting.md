# Assumptions
1. Imperfect competition in the goods market,
	1. Firms are price-makers,
	2. Set prices as a mark-up above MC depending on the elasticity of demand $\eta$.
	3. This affects the real wage offered by firms.
	- Under perfect competition, firms pay workers their full marginal output.
	- In imperfect competition, there is a mark-up:
$$
\frac{W}{P}=(1-\mu)MPL
$$Also:
$$
\frac{\eta}{\eta-1}= (1+\mu)
$$
And:
$$
\frac{\eta-1}{\eta}=\frac{1}{1+\mu}\approx 1-\mu
$$
So:
- Real wages are a positive function of demand elasticity, but a negative function of the mark-up.

2. Prices respond immediately to nominal wages.
	- In practice this is not the case - we know there is some lag.
	- Workers tend to be slow to react to increases in productivity which allows periods of rising real wages or falling prices before the other reacts.
3. Other factors that shift the price-setting curve downward are *price-push factors* $Z_{p}$:
	- Cost of inputs,
	- Taxation,
	- Red-tape,
	- Financialisation - dividend claims.
## Graphically
- If we assume that the marginal product of labour decreases as output rises:

- If the marginal product stays constant, these lines become perfectly elastic.

Equation:
$$
PS=\frac{W}{P}=\lambda(+) f(\mu(-),Z_{p}(-))
$$
- Where:
	- $\lambda$ is the marginal product of labour,
	- $\mu$ is the mark-up,
	- $Z_{p}$ are price-push factors.
# Unemployment
>Merging the price-setting curve with a perfectly competitive labour-supply curve shows that:
![[Pasted image 20241106221014.png]]
1. Firms' mark-ups generate unemployment.
2. An increase in the elasticity of labour supply or a decrease in the mark-up will increase employment,
3. A decrease in price push factors - i.e., more competitive input markets, or reduced taxation and administrative costs - increase employment.

*Slightly more controversial claims:*
- Lowering the cost of finance will increase employment,
- Increasing productivity will increase employment.
