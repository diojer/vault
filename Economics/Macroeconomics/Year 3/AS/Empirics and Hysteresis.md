# Summary
- WS-PS tells us that $N_{e}$ (equilibrium unemployment) is only determined by $Z_{W}$, $\mu$ and $Z_{P}$.
	- This is supported by empirical examples like the UK and the Netherlands, the USA and Europe and Panel Data from OECD countries.
		- However, other European countries with what should be high $Z_{W}$ have lower $N_{e}$ than the USA.
- Hysteresis suggests that $N_{e}$ is determined not only by the labour and goods market, but also by macroeconomic policies.
	- The difference between potential and actual output affects long-term unemployment, which can itself influence potential unemployment.
# United Kingdom and the Netherlands
- UK:
	- Rising wage-push factors $Z_{w}$ throughout the 70s following the French May '68 student protests.
	- Thatcher's labour market reforms and deregulation of the goods markets reduced union power and increased competition, reducing $Z_{w}$ and $Z_{p}$.
	- Blair's "New Deal" reformed the benefits system, reducing wage-push factors $Z_{w}$
- Netherlands:
	- Rising $Z_{w}$ throughout the 70s,
	- Wassenaar Agreements with unions in the 80s moderated wage growth,
	- Benefits and tax reforms in the 90s reduced wage-push and price-push factors.

# Europe and the USA
Europe's experience is thought to lend support to the WS-PS hypothesis.
- Overall, Europe has had a more regulated goods market and rising wage-push factors since the 70s compared to the USA.

However, in the 60s where European unemployment ==was lower==, the USA still had a less regulated goods market and weaker wage-push factors.
- Some European countries still perform on par, or better than, the USA even with higher $Z_{w}$ and $Z_{p}$.
# Panel Analysis
![[Pasted image 20241110150212.png]]
- Effects of wage-push factors on **unemployment**.
	- Can more restrictive, but socially beneficial, labour market institutions be "balanced" or "compensated" by those that decrease unemployment?

Some problems with the panel analysis:
1. The variance of the estimates presents problems:
	- Maximum estimates are two (or more) times as large as lower estimates.
	- Results are [not robust to changes in the timespan or unitspan](obsidian://open?vault=PPE&file=Shared%20Notes%2FEconomics%2FMacroeconomics%2FYear%203%2FReadings%2FHowell20et20al_Institutions20and20Unemployment_march15.07.pdf)
2. Studies focus on the impact of wage-push factors, but overlook impact of price-push factors (like goods market competition).
	- OECD now produces product market regulation indicators. Not much research but results do support theoretical notions.
3. There is ==evidence that macroeconomic shocks affect NAIRU, not just current unemployment==.
	- This phenomenon is known as **hysteresis**.
# Hysteresis
>Term borrowed from physics - signifies a "path dependence" or a "scarring effect".
>Hysteresis hypothesis posits the idea that a sustained shock can reduce the unemployment equilibrium such that when the shock is dealt with the NAIRU will be higher, or lower, than it was originally.
## Historical Examples
- The main historical examples centre around the following chronology:
	- Low unemployment $\to$ macroeconomic shock $\to$ inflation above target $\to$ central bank responds by increasing interest rates $\to$ disinflation $\to$ inflation at target $\to$ unemployment higher than before.
### United Kingdom and France

- Red lines represent unemployment equilibrium before and after inflationary period.
- [Ball (2009) suggests finds that actions by central banks did reduce the NAIRU.](obsidian://open?vault=PPE&file=Shared%20Notes%2FEconomics%2FMacroeconomics%2FYear%203%2FReadings%2Fw14818.pdf)
## Policy Implications
Hysteresis suggests an alternative explanation for the Europe-USA gap:
- More restrictive monetary and fiscal policy $\to$ longer recessions $\to$ hysteresis.
	- 80-90s restrictive EU Monetary policy,
	- 90-00s restrictive EU Fiscal policy toward EURO-convergence,
	- 2010s restrictive EU-UK Fiscal policy (austerity),
	- 2021 - Biden's Covid Recovery plan vs European Recovery plan?

Essentially, the hysteresis hypothesis contradicts the [[Shared Notes/Economics/Macroeconomics/Year 3/AS/Wage and Price Setting|WS-PS model proposed by LNJ]].
- The equilibrium employment level is determined in the labour and goods markets, but ==these markets can be influenced by macroeconomic policy, like fiscal and monetary policy==.
	- This hypothesis is rejected by most central banks.
## Modelling Hysteresis: Long-term unemployment model
Layard and Bean (1989), suggest that macroeconomic shocks that **increase the duration of unemployment modify the employment equilibrium**.
- The probability of reemployment falls with the length of unemployment. This is called "lower search effectiveness".
- Long term unemployment is defined, typically, as being unemployed for ==52 weeks or longer==.

Lower search effectiveness means that the long-term unemployed are no longer competition for others in the labour market.
- This means that unemployment becomes less of a threat.
	- In the [[Wage Setting#Model 2 Shirking Model|Shirking model]], this means firms will *raise wages* to maintain the opportunity cost of shirking,
	- In the [[Wage Setting#With a Monopolistic Union|Monopoly union model]], unions will push for higher wages.
- So, an increase in the number of long-term unemployed will *raise wages*, shifting the wage-setting curve and reducing the employment equilibrium.
	- ==Question: why does the firm raising wages cause a shift in the WS curve? Shouldn't it create movement in the PS curve?==
### Graphically
Relationship between long-term unemployment and employment:
- When employment is low, we would expect there to be a high number of long-term unemployed (LTU) workers. When employment is high, we would expect the opposite.
![[Pasted image 20241110175814.png]]

As the share of LTU increases, the efficient wage increases - this is because the opportunity cost of *shirking* has decreased, because competition in the labour market has decreased (LTU job-seekers are not seen as a contributing factor to $h$, i.e., $h=1-(u-LTU)$).
- This shifts WS upward:

### LTU Policy Implications
The textbook is optimistic:
- LTU will be reduced eventually - policies necessary are those that connect the LTU with work, i.e., "welfare to work" programs.
	- These are typically bunched as Active Labour Market Policies (ALMP).

The lecturer (Rodriguez-Gil) and others are pessimistic:
- Reducing LTU requires an *extremely protracted process* - this is backed up by evidence.
![[Pasted image 20241110191722.png]]
- This model shows how many quarters the LTU levels took to get back to normal levels, following the 1984, 1991, and 2004 shocks to employment.
	- The black line, 1984, took 5 years.
	- The long-dotted line, 1991, took 10 years.
	- The short-dotted line, 2004, did not go back to its pre-shock levels.
[Ball (1999, 2009)](obsidian://open?vault=PPE&file=Shared%20Notes%2FEconomics%2FMacroeconomics%2FYear%203%2FReadings%2Fw14818.pdf) recommends *rapid macro policy intervention* to counter negative shocks, before search effectiveness is eroded, i.e., before those unemployed by the shock enter LTU.

Blanchard & Summers (1986, p. 72) suggests that reverse hysteresis is possible.
- Positive responses to macroeconomic shocks should be engineered.
