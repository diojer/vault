- Inflation in the New Consensus Model is modelled as output which requires employment above the "equilibrium" level, natural level, or NAIRU.
- When output is above equilibrium, workers will either:
	- Increase wage demands, in the case of a monopoly union,
	- Require higher wages to exert the same amount effort, in the case of efficiency wages.
- This will increase costs to producers and require and increase in prices,
	- They are comfortable increasing prices as the increase in cost is a macro-phenomena, rather than isolated to one particular industry or firm.
- NAIRU, or, the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment, is the point at which current output will not necessitate a rise or fall in wages, and so will not trigger a wage-price push which increases inflation.

Unions care about real wages as that is what will affect their utility, but only receive nominal wages.
In terms of nominal wages,
$$
W=P^E \cdot B(N,z_{w})
$$
This tells us that nominal wages $W$ are dependant on the expected price level $P^E$, the level of employment $N$ and a set of wage-push factors (such as union bargaining power), $z_{w}$.
We can divide by the price level to find real wages.
- Assuming efficiency wages, the wage-setting curve is asymptotic. This is because as involuntary unemployment approaches zero, i.e., as employment approaches the full labour supply, the wage must be higher and higher to incentivise productive work (as it becomes easier and easier to find a job elsewhere).
	- The wage-setting curve also approaches the flat part of the labour-supply curve asymptotically, because as the wage approaches the opportunity cost of working (unemployment benefits + disutility of work) it must always be slightly higher to incentivise people to work.

While $\frac{W}{P}$ tells us the real wage per worker, $\mu\lambda$ tells us the real profit per worker, where $\mu$ is mark-up and $\lambda$ is productivity.

## Taxes
Convention is to measure the price level as $P_{c}=P(1+t_{c})$ where $t_{c}$ are the indirect taxes placed on consumption, i.e., $P_{c}$ captures CPI movements.
Real wages are measured as real consumption wages, i.e., $w_{c}=\frac{W}{P_{c}}$.
- On the other hand, the real wage that is of relevance to the employer is the real product wage.
- The difference between the real wage the producer experiences vs. the real wage the consumer receives is known as the *tax wedge*.
