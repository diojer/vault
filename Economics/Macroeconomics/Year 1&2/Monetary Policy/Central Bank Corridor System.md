# The Interbank Market
At the end of the day, some banks will have too much/little liquidity. They will lend to each other to eliminate this excess/deficit.
The central bank has the power to set the private banks' loan/deposit interest rates. It does this by setting its own loan/deposit rates:
- The lending facility rate,
- The deposit rate.
By setting these rates and loaning out money perfectly elastically at these prices, it ensures the interbank market rates lie between these two rates.

They want you to keep a small quantity in reserve, which is why there's such high interest rates right at the beginning.
