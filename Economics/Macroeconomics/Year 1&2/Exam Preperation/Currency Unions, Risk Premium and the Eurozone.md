**Two identical economies begin where actual output is equal to potential output. Economy A experiences a positive demand shock due to a fall in the risk premium, Economy B experiences an equivalent negative demand shock due to a rise in the risk premium. Explain the problem faced by a central bank of asymmetric demand shocks in a currency union. Discuss how fiscal transfers or labour mobility can be used to address asymmetric demand shocks. Including the distributional implications between and within economies, what are the costs and benefits of each approach to addressing asymmetric shocks? Is the European Monetary Union more or less likely to have problems with asymmetric demand shocks over time?**

## Eurozone
- Since the financial crisis, there are now small adjustment funds to send to countries in the case of shocks.
	- Given that the AfD is very popular in Germany, there doesn't seem to be a big desire to be more sharing within the EU anytime soon.
- The rise of nationalist parties in general is going to hurt any harmonious European project.
	- A lot of parties want to set limits on the free movement of labour.
