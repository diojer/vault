## Wage Setting
We can capture the determination of wages using the following equations:
$$
\begin{gather}
W=P^ef(u,z) \\
P^e ~\text{is the expected price level} \\
u ~\text{is the unemployment rate} \\
z ~\text{refers to labour bargaining power}
\end{gather}
$$
*z* could refer to unemployment insurance, level of employment protection, minimum wages, and trade union membership.

## Price Setting
Firms generally set prices based on their costs of production.
These generally include labour, materials, capital, and opportunity costs. 
However, for now we will assume labour is their only cost.

*In this situation, under perfect competition, the cost of producing one additional unit of output is the wage paid to workers. Prices will be set equal to this wage. This gives us the equation:*
$$
P=W
$$

Many goods markets, however, are not perfectly competitive and firms charge a price higher than their marginal cost. This can be captured by the following equation:
$$
P=(1+m)W
$$
Where *m* is our mark-up. As market structures tend towards perfect competition, m $\rightarrow$ 0, and the wage will equal the price level. 
The equation can also be rearranged as:
$$
\frac{W}{P} = \frac{1}{1+m}
$$
