## The Composition of GDP
---
	- Consumption (C): Goods and services purchased by consumers
	- Investment (I): The sum of nonresidential investments and residential investments
	- Gov. Spending (G): Purchases of goods and services by the federal, state and local governments
	- Exports (X): Purchases of UK goods by foreigners
	- Imports (IM): Purchases of foreign goods by UK consumers, firms and government.

Aggregate demand is equal to 
	C+I+G+(X-IM). #formula
For more detail see the [[The Circular Flow|circular flow diagram]].

## Variables
**Endogenous** variable: Variables depend on other variables in the model
**Exogenous** variable: Variables not explained within the model but taken as a given

Consumption is an endogenous variable. The consumption function is:
	C=c0+c1(Y-T) #formula
c0 is autonomous consumption (intercept), c1 is the marginal propensity to consume (slope), Y is income, T is tax, Y-T is there disposable income.
The intercept represents what people would consume if disposable income was zero, in other words, basic necessities such as heating and water.

#### Autonomous Variables
We are assuming that investment, government consumption, and taxation are autonomous. 

## Keynesian Cross
Using this information, our new equation for aggregate demand is:
	AD = c0+c1(Y-T)+I+G #formula

Equilibrium in the goods market requires that Y = AD.
This line where Y = AD can be interpreted as the supply. For any given aggregate demand, producers will try to match it by producing an equal amount. Thus, they want income to be at the point where all demand can be satiated. This is gives rise to the following equilibrium point, E:

At E, C=AD, thus in an efficient market the consumption will also equal the aggregate supply.
