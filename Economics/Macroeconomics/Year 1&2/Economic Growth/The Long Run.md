#economics
In the short and medium run, labour was assumed to be our only variable factor of production.
In this case, capital is implicitly assumed to be fixed.

The formal definition of the long run is that there are no fixed factors of production. 
- The population can grow and be educated
- We can invest to increase the amount of capital in the economy
- We can make new technological discoveries
- We can change how the economy is organised
