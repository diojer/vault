1. Consider the key assumptions
	1. Perfectly competitive Markets - many different kinds of market structures in the modern world, e.g., Oligopolies, Monopolies, Natural Monopolies. The main structure today is monopolistic competition.
	2. Perfect Information - We are approaching perfect information with a lot of industries, but actually achieving that doesn't seem possible,
	3. Rational Agents - Most people don't act perfectly rationally, sometimes there's not enough time to fully lay out your thought process
	4. One period, static model - Two periods model real life much more accurately. One period doesn't factor in loaning/saving very accurately.
	5. Individual firms maximise profits, identical households maximise utility - Satisficing is the usual approach of most firms and households.
2. What are the main criticisms of the labour supply function?
	1. Assumes that unemployment is a choice - if you're unemployed, it's for leisure purposes.
		1. Workers can also gain disutility from leisure, i.e., stress from unemployment,
		2. Workers can gain utility from work that is meaningful to them.
	2. Workers cannot substitute between work and leisure at their own discretion
		1. In countries where there isn't good public infrastructure for childcare/elderly care, women's supply of labour doesn't increase with real wages.
		2. Companies may want to consume more labour, but they may be constrained by working-hour/minimum wage regulations
3. Compare two functions for output $Y=AN$ and $Y=AN^{1-\alpha}$.
	1. Similarities:
		1. Both are functions to calculate output,
		2. Both are the same if the capital share of output is 0,
		3. Both imply a positive relationship between output and labour
	2. Differences:
		1. $Y=AN^{1-\alpha}$ has diminishing returns to labour input. This is clear if we take the first and second derivative;
			1. $$
			\begin{eqnarray}
			\frac{\delta Y}{\delta N}&=&(1-\alpha)AN^{-\alpha} \\
			\frac{\delta^2Y}{\delta N^2}&=&-\alpha(1-\alpha)AN^{-\alpha-1}
			\end{eqnarray}
			$$
		2. $Y=AN$ has constant returns to labour input,
4. Once we relax the assumption of perfect competition (and introduce mark-up), workers stop being paid the marginal productivity of their labour.

# Constant Returns to Labour?
5. Post-Keynesian thought generally prefers $Y=AN$ with the exception of a few sectors of the economy, whereas neoclassical economists prefer $Y=AN^{1-\alpha}$.
	1. Post-Keynesians think firms are generally operating with excess capacity, meaning that they are employing only 75%-90% of their capital. In this situation, employing more labour will not lead to diminishing returns.
		1. Since firms don't have perfect information, they leave spare capacity due to their uncertainty on whether demand will rise. Post-Keynesians call this "fundamental uncertainty".
