When we combine the [[Shared Notes/Economics/Macroeconomics/Year 1&2/New Keynesian IS-LM-PC/Wage and Price Setting#Price Setting|price setting]] and [[Shared Notes/Economics/Macroeconomics/Year 1&2/New Keynesian IS-LM-PC/Wage and Price Setting#Wage Setting|wage setting]] curves we can derive the Phillips curve in terms of difference between inflation and expected inflation:
$$
\pi_t-\pi^e=(\frac{\alpha}{L})(Y-Y_n)
$$
Where:
- $\pi_t$ is the current level of inflation,
- $\pi^e$ is the expected inflation
	- $\bar{\pi}$ is the target inflation, it is usually equal to $\pi^e$.
- $\alpha$ is the slope parameter,
- $L$ is the labour output,
- $Y$ is the current level of output,
- $Y_n$ is potential output.

From the equation, we can see if inflation is equal to its target, there is no output gap, i.e., we are producing at our output potential.

If output is greater than potential, e.g., post pandemic, our inflation will be greater than our target inflation.
