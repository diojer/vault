# Examples
## Michigan
Michigan could've benefitted from lower interest rates and a depreciated currency during the recession, however the Federal Reserve has to set the interest rate for all states in the USA.

## North UK
A booming London could've benefitted from higher interest rates, whereas less developed/growing areas could've used lower interest rates.
## Eurozone
The PIIGS countries could've used different monetary policy during the recession as opposed to higher income countries such as Germany.
# Benefits of a Common Currency
- Lower transaction costs
- Lower uncertainty (no exchange rate fluctuations)
- Price transparency
- Greater levels of trade
- Potential for high quality monetary policy
- One central bank, many governments
	- Harder to finance debt
		- Lower inflation (potentially)
# Costs
## Asymmetric Shocks
This is where two economies sharing the same currency are hit by a shock in two different ways.
### Example: Sterling pegged to Deutschmark
The UK pegged the pound sterling to the Deutschmark. However, with the UK experiencing a recession and Germany experiencing an economic boom, the German central bank increased interest rates. To maintain the exchange rate, the UK was forced to increase interest rates, worsening the recession.

### Solution: Labour Mobility
Rather than the central bank shifting the LM curve in response to an IS shock, one possible solution is for the wage-setting curve to shift, moving the natural rate of unemployment and reducing inflation in both countries without a change in monetary policy.

#### Problems
While inflation has normalised, country B now has much lower output.
### Solution: Fiscal Transfers
The country experiencing inflation could increase taxes and spend the money in the country experiencing a recession.
#### Problems
It may not be politically viable to raise taxes in one country to pay for problems in another country.
# Criteria for a Common Currency
- Is there factor (capital, labour) mobility?
- Do all countries produce a wide and similar range of goods?
	- They will likely be impacted by shocks more symmetrically,
	- However, trade integration will likely increase the level of specialisation.
- Is there a high degree of trade openness?
- Are there institutions to provide insurance e.g. fiscal transfers?
- Do countries share common views?
- A strong belief in a shared destiny.
## Does the Eurozone meet the criteria?
- EU international labour mobility is much lower than US interstate labour mobility.
- Trade specialisation has been increasing in the EU in general
- Being a part of the Eurozone requires a focus on small fiscal deficits
- Many Europeans do not feel like they are a citizen of the EU rather than their own country.
The European Monetary Union is clearly not a "textbook" example of an optimal currency area.
