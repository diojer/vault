Trade takes place in tangibles (goods) and intangibles (services).
# Link between Trade and Output
- Competition
	- Companies are incentivised to cut costs and develop new technologies.
- Learning and innovation
	- Firms that trade gain more exposure to foreign technology
- Economies of scale
	- Firms that can export to the world face higher demand and can operate at larger scales where the price per unit of output is lower.
## Regression Analysis
$$
ln (y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 ln(trade~share)+\epsilon
$$
We encounter some problems of endogeneity, for example, if we have more output we may be able to afford more goods from foreign economies. To solve this problem, we need to look at exogenous factors that affect trade shares but not output.
An example of this is the paper by Frankel and Romer (1999) that used geographic size and distance. They found a 1%-point increase in trade share increases GDP per capita by 0.5-2%.
Feyrer (2021) used the closure of the Suez canal from 1967 to 1975 to measure the impact of increased trade distance, finding that trade is negatively affected by increased distance.
Estevadeordal and Taylor (2013) found liberalising tariffs were associated with faster economic growth.

In contrast, Juh√°sz (2018) found that regions in France protected from British trade increased capacity in mechanised cotton spinning compared to those exposed to trade - this is an example of growing an economy via import substitution.
An alternative method of growing an economy is via export-oriented industrialisation - a country joins a trade network to try to develop strong exports. Surpluses from this sector can help develop the domestic economy.
