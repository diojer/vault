- Exports are a function of global output, $Y^*$, and the domestic exchange rate, $\epsilon$.
- Imports are a function of domestic output, $Y$, and the domestic exchange rate, $\epsilon$.
Exports and imports increase with output, but exports decrease with a rise in the exchange rate, whereas imports increase.

## Determining the real exchange rate
$$
\epsilon=\frac{P}{P^*}E
$$
Where:
- P is domestic prices
- $P^*$ is foreign prices
- E is the nominal exchange rate
P and $P^*$ are normalised to 1. So, real and nominal exchange rates are equal.
Since there is no inflation, real interest rates are also equal to nominal exchange rates.
