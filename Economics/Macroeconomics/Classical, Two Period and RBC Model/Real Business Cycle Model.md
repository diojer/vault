## Assumptions
- Households live for two periods
- Households have perfect foresight
- Households choose how much to work
- In period 1, households choose how much to work, $N_1$ where $0<N_1<1$, how much to consume, $C_1$, and how much to save, $S_1$.
- In period 2, households choose how much to work, $N_2$, and spend all remaining income.
- We introduce $e^{-\rho}$, impatience

## Model
Household utility:
$$
U=c_1+bln(1-N_1)+e^{-\rho}[c_2+bln(1-N_2)]
$$
Household lifetime budget constraint:
$$
c_1+\frac{c_2}{1+r}=w_1N_1+\frac{w_2N_2}{1+r}
$$
Where:
- $ln(X)=x$
- $C_1$ is the consumption in period 1,
- $C_2$ is the consumption in period 2,
- $r$ is the rate of interest,
- $W$ is the nominal wage,
- $N_1$ is the proportion of hours worked in the first period,
- $N_2=1-N_1$.

## Questions
- How is $e^{-\rho}$ different from $\alpha$ we had in the two period model?
