The Phillips curve is a combination of our knowledge of the labour market and unemployment, with the rate of inflation.
In 1958, A.W. Phillips found clear evidence of a negative relationship between wage inflation and unemployment in the UK between 1861 and 1957.
The relationship between unemployment and inflation is now known as the Phillips curve. This relation broke down in the 1970s, however re-emerged as a negative relationship between unemployment and the rate of change of inflation.

The relationship is as follows:
$$
P=P^e(1+m)(1-\alpha u+z)
$$
And can also be expressed in terms of inflation:
$$
\pi_t=\pi_t^e+(m+z)-\alpha u_t
$$
Where:
- $W$ Denotes wages
- $P$ Denotes prices
- $m$ denotes markup
- $z$ denotes labour-bargaining power
- $u$ denotes unemployment
- The subscript $t$ denotes a particular time, and the superscript $e$ denotes an expected value.
