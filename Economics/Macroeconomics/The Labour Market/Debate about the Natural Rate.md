Labour market rigidities and a high $z$ is often blamed for Europe's high rate of unemployment. However:
1. Unemployment was not always high in Europe, despite having the same labour market rigidities.
2. A number of countries had low unemployment pre-2008

There is an open debate about the best institutional structure for the labour market.

There are some reasons for the fall in US unemployment rate:
- Increased globalisation and competition
- Weaker trade unions
- Wider use of temporary help agencies
- Ageing US population
- Increased incarceration rates
- Increased number of workers on disability benefits

Keynesian Economists argue the following:
- Unemployment is driven by demand as well as supply
- The economy can have multiple equilibria
- Alternatively, the economy does not have an equilibrium unemployment rate
