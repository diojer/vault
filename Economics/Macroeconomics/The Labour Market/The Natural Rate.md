Where the wage and price-setting curves cross gives us our natural rate of unemployment.
This leaves us with the following equation:
$$
f(u,z) = \frac{1}{1+m}
$$
At equilbrium, our determined level of unemployment is the natural rate of unemployment, $u^n$. Changes in $z$ and $m$ affect $u^n$.

An increased $z$ (bargaining power) will increases real wages.
An increased $m$ (mark-up) will decrease real wages.
