Short run policies which we've already looked at include:
- Monetary Policy (i - shifts in the LM curve)
- Fiscal Policy (G, T - shifts in the IS curve)
Monetary policy is fairly fast acting, however fiscal policy can take up to 18-24 months.

Other policies, such as labour market reform, or product market institution reform, may take longer to affect the economy. These fall under the umbrella of supply-side policy.
We'll use:
- *z* to represent labour-bargaining power,
- *m* to represent competition between firms (aka mark-up)
