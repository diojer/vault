The following thought experiment is an example of the effect of partiality:
- Would you rather save your parents or two strangers from drowning? There are 4 options:
	- Parents
	- Strangers
	- Random chance (flip a coin)
	- Neither
Almost all people would rather save their parents, because they are *partial* to them over random strangers.

Other than certain circumstances, e.g. being a referee, hirer, etc., we don't usually condemn partiality. In fact, it may be encouraged.

There seem to be...
- *Duties* of Partiality,
- *Reasons* of Partiality (which don't amount to a full obligation)

## Puzzle of Partiality
It seems to be a basic moral truth that - morally speaking - no one is more important than anyone else. So how can morality - which is supposed to be impartial - give rise to partial duties/reasons? [Simon Keller](https://www.simonkeller.co.nz/)calls this the puzzle of partiality.

Partiality can be important, because some cases of partiality are contested:
- Compatriots
- Race

## Why do you have a moral obligation to save your parents?
Maybe the obligations aren't moral. Earlier you said you could save your parents but still do the *worst* thing. So, worst in this case refers to the morality, but people might forgive you for doing something immoral because of sympathies they have for you.

## Partiality from Impartiality?
Duties of partiality might create problems for "impartialist" moral theories, like [[Consequentialism|consequentialism]]. However, perhaps the **most effective way** to promote overall goodness is for each of us to promote the good among our "nearest and dearest".

### Jackon's Crowd Control Analogy
To motivate this, Jackson draws an analogy with a police inspector using their squad to control a crowd at a football match.
1. You could assign your squad to try to wander the entire crowd and try to ensure everyone is behaving
2. Alternatively, you could section of parts of the crowd for each officer and have them focus on their particular section.
Possible counterarguments:
- Should the officers prioritise their own sections, even when doing so will harm the event as a whole.
- We often know **full well** that we could promote more overall goodness by **not** prioritising our family and friends.
- Rather than looking after your parents, you could put that time into volunteering for a charity.

## Bernard Williams: One Thought too Many
Williams (1918) argues that consequentialist justifications of partial behaviour involve "one thought too many"

In justifying saving only your parents with Jackon's analogy, you may seem cold and calculating.

## The Projects View
Certain commitments in our life are central to our identities, in the sense that they give meaning to our life.
Ground projects can give rise to special reasons.
- If you are deeply committed to becoming a novelist, that gives you a good reason to spend your time working on your book over other things.
- Other relationships often feature in our ground projects, e.g., we care deeply about being good parents, good children, good siblings.
Maybe what morally justifies partial behaviour, then, is our "ground" projects.

### Objection 1 (Keller): Projects cannot explain duties
1. Certain relationships give rise to duties or obligations,
2. Ground projects cannot give rise to duties or obligations
	- You don't have a *moral duty* to work on your novel, if you are deeply committed to becoming a novelist
3. Therefore, ground projects cannot explain duties of partiality.
Maybe joint projects can solve this? I.e., promising something to someone, e.g., to be partial to them, may allow you to be morally consistent when you *are* being partial.

You can have reasons of partiality without ground projects, though:
- Fleeting friendships,
- Parents who don't care about being parents,
And you can have ground projects without reasons of partiality:
- Someone who is racist, e.g., a member of the KKK, has this as a ground project. However, they are not granted moral reasons to *be* racist, i.e., to be partial to members of their own race.

## The Relationships View
While the projects view is mainly about *you*, the relationships view concerns both you *and* the other person (e.g., parents, friends, partner, etc.,).

This view usually takes the following form:
1. Certain relationships are intrinsically valuable,
2. This value gives rise to special responsibilities

We think that (2) is plausible because we usually accept it in other areas. For example, if we take beauty to have intrinsic value, that might explain why we have duties to look after works of art.

### Objection 1 (Keller): Reasons without Value
The problem lies in the fact that relationships give rise to special reasons even if we *don't* think they're valuable.
- We can take the 2013 film, "There's Something about Mary" as an example,
- Ted does *not* think his relationship with Mary is valuable (he is a mere stalker),
- Ted still thinks he has reasons to act partially towards Mary,
### Objection 2 (Keller): Are there intrinsically valuable relationships?
These relationships are always either **instrumentally** or **extrinsically** valuable.
- Most relationships are sources of great happiness, but some relationships are dysfunctional and toxic and people are worse off and less happy than they otherwise would be.
Defenders of the relationship view don't necessarily support staying in a toxic relationship, just that a toxic relationship has intrinsic value.
Keller objects, and says that once a relationship is shown to be toxic, there is no reason to stay in it.
### Objection 3 (Keller): Motivation
Again, Keller points out that latching the moral reason onto the relationship creates distorted reasoning, i.e., are we only saving our parents out of a concern for our relationship, or out of a concern for *them* themselves?
## The Individuals View (Keller's View)
This concerns only the *other* people in the partial relationship.
- In Keller's view, these individuals (i.e., your parents) are valuable, and this value merits special treatment.
This fits well with our perceived motivations when we save them, i.e., "Oh no! My parents are in danger!"
### Concerns
This doesn't seem to address the questions concerning *why* your parents are more valuable than the strangers you could save instead.

# Challenges to Partial Behaviour
If we assume that all attempts to justify partial behaviour have failed, we have grounds to believe that partial behaviour might be unjustifiable.

## Challenge 1 (Crisp): The Racial Analogy Challenge
We think it's obvious to be partial to our friends and family. However, in the past, it was thought to be obvious to act partially to people of your own race - something most of us agree is wrong today.
To justify partial behaviour to our friends/family, we have to meaningfully differentiate those relationships from a racial relationship.
### Concerns
This is highly revisionary, and it means we have no special obligations to friends, family or partners.

## Challenge 2 (Lazari-Radek and Singer): The Evolutionary Debunking Argument
1. Some moral judgements are likely to be advantageous when it comes to natural selection
	1. For example, the judgement we have stronger reason to help our own children than complete strangers.
	2. These children are more likely to survive and pass on this judgement to their own children.
2. Other moral judgements seem disadvantageous
	1. For example, an impartial principle.
This gives rise to great concern, because if you learn you would believe $p$ **even if** not-$p$, this undermines your justification for a belief in $p$. It means you are *insensitive* to the facts.
For example, thinking that your child is the most talented in the class, and then learning you would think this *even if* they weren't.
Since partiality is evolutionary useful, it means that moral claim is insensitive to any actual moral facts, so we have no reason to believe partiality has moral basis.

- Is it possible that partial obligations are immoral, but everyone just forgives you?
