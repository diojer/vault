# Five Approaches to Unethical Consumption
In this section, Lawford-Smith maps out five approaches to generating an individual's obligations when it comes to ethical consumption.
## 1: Task Responsibility
- Philosophers generally differentiate between *task-responsibility* and *blame-responsibility*.
	- The latter assigns responsibility on the basis of culpability,
	- The former assigns responsibility without blame, on the basis of being the most appropriate person to do something
- Consumers cause harms:
	- Companies produce more goods
	- Goods are produced in a way that involves harms
- However, consumers lack blame-responsibility because they generally lack features of culpability:
	- Foreseeing the harm,
	- Intending the harm,
	- Negligently risking the harm
- Do consumers bear task responsibility?
	- In the case of the state, task responsibility gives a post hoc justification for using taxes in a certain way.
	- However, increasing prices is just a means to an end, that is, to stop harms to current and future persons. If people are happy paying higher taxes or higher prices, the problem persists.
		- **Not a great argument - we generally know that if prices are high enough, enough people will stop doing them that harms can be mitigated/eradicated**.
## 2: Benefiting from injustice
