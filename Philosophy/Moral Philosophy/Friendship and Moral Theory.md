### Notes on Alienation, Consequentialism and the Demands of Morality
In general, moral theories like [[Consequentialism]] pose some issues in the demands they make of regular people. For example, it is often posited that one should sell all of their possessions and become a charity worker in a developing nation. Is it true that abstaining from this is bad?
Furthermore, there can be elements of alienation: a project that you think is morally good, for example abstaining from purchasing shirts made in a sweatshop, could be easily overturned if the consequentialist calculus said to.

Railton will focus on the question of whether or not problems, with regards to alienation, present a serious problem to consequentialism.
