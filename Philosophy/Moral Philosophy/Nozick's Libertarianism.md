Nozick's conception is [[Deontology|deontological]] in character.
This follows on from general [[Libertarianism|libertarianism]].

Nozick has two projects:
1. The anarchist challenge: a minimal state $can$ be morally justified
2. The non-anarchist challenge: $only$ a minimal state can be morally justified

Nozick begins with his notion of distributive justice, which follows three rules.
1. Justice of holding
	- A person who acquires a holding in accordance with the principle of justice in acquisition is entitled to this holding
2. Justice of transfer
	- A person who acquires a holding in accordance with the principle of justice in transfer is entitled to this holding
3. Rectification of injustice in holdings
	- The more nebulous of the three. Nozick does not fully describe how this rectification ought to take place, just that it should and the process is arguable.

## Entitlement Theory
Nozick builds on the Kantian view that humans should be treated as ends in themselves, not simply means.
Nozick thinks that we can never sacrifice the right of self ownership:
- This is a [[Libertarianism#Property Rights|property right]] which we have over ourselves.
No one is entitled to a holding except by applications of rules 1 and 2. Rule 3 is only applicable in cases where someone is not entitled to their holding.

## Historical Principles vs. Time Slice Principles
Nozick distinguishes between two ideas:
1. Historical Principles
2. Time Slice Principles
He says that any implementation of rule 3 should be characterised by the former, and not the latter. Welfare economics, as a representative of the latter, do not take into account any sort of historical precedent which led to the situation as we see it know. Typically, welfare economics tends to analyse things as they are now, and offer diagrams representing a discrete timeslice.
Alternatively, Nozick says we should focus more on what led up to the creation of inequalities, in order to decide whether or not they are just. He brings up the example of a socialist, who may not agree with a certain distribution *A*, even if it is the exact same as another distribution *B*, because in *A* a capitalist class are in dominant possession of resources, whereas in *B* it is the working class.
Nozick agrees with the hypothetical socialist's perspective and concludes that historical precedent is necessary in determing a just situation.

## Patterning
Nozick describes how some people wish to formulate just societies, by forcing the distribution of goods to adhere to some sort of pattern. An example of a pattern might be that people with higher IQs deserve more, or that people with lower IQs deserve more, etc. Any kind of distribution of justice along some natural property is a kind of patterning.
Generally, a patterned notion of distribution will follow the syntax (we will call construction *C*):
	From each according to his $x$, to each according to his $y$.

He says that his entitlement theory is specifically *not* patterned (although by some gimmicky, convoluted way it may be argued that it is).  Therefore, he does not think it is fair to try to apply his notion of entitlement to *C*. However, if it had to be done, it would be the following:
	From each according to his *choice*, to each as they are *chosen*.

## How Liberty Upsets Patterns
Nozick starts by supposing that we already live in a completely equal society, which has realised some sort of patterned distribution $D_1$, and we can make the assumption that $D_1$ is completely just.

Then, he takes the example of people going to a basketball game, where one of the players, Wilt Chamberlain, is receiving a royalty of 25% of all ticket sales (we will assume that he is not gouging the ticket vendors). Tickets are $1 each. Then, a million people attend the basketball game, and Wilt ends up with an extra $250,000. This new distribution, we will call $D_2$. How can we argue that $D_2$ is unjust, given that all steps between $D_1$ and $D_2$ were completely voluntary?

He also takes some measures into account in order to argue against a hypothetical socialist world, where possibly money does not exist.
With all this taken into account, his conclusion is that entrepeneurship and private enterprise will always upset any given pattern distribution, because by free assocation people must necessarily disturb the pattern (unless it is the pattern (which is not really a pattern) that he stated earlier).
He distills three main reasons as to why liberty will always upset patterns:
1. Not all people will want to remain in the pattern
2. Not everyone can gather sufficient information to figure out how they are disturbing the pattern
3. Diverse and geographically distant groups of people cannot co-ordinate their actions simply to adhere to a pattern
