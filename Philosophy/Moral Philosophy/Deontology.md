Deontology differs from [[Consequentialism|consequentialism]] because the morality of an act is concerned with an act in itself rather than its outcome. In relation to the [[The Trolley Problem|trolley problem]], deontologists advocate *not* pulling the lever, or pushing the large man on the [[The Trolley Problem#Footbridge Problem|footbridge]].

Many deontologists make room for rights, imposing constraints upon pursuing the best outcome.
Bringing about the best outcome is not always morally required.

**Absolute deontology**
It is always morally impermissible to violate someone's rights.
Murder at the door case:
	If there is a murderer at the door and asks where your family is hiding, you should tell them (since lying is wrong).

**Threshold deontology**
Moral restrictions have weight, however can be overriden when the consequences are dire enough.
Ticking bomb case:
	If you catch a terrorist who knows where a bomb is, which will go off in a few minutes, it is fair to torture them to figure out where it is.

**Stringency of duties**
Deontologists make a distinction between negative and positive duties.
**Negative duty**: Refrain from acting/intending to act in certain ways, e.g. killing, stealing...
**Positive duty**: Act/intend to act in certain ways: e.g. duty to help others...

There are two common kinds of deontology:
**Agent-focused**: Emphasis on the person acting, and their duties
**Patient-focused**: Emphasis on the person being acted *on*.

# Agent Focused Deontology
To answer whether an action is right or wrong, we should focus on the person acting. 

## Intention Based Views
Morality requires that you have/lack certain intentions.
It is impermissible to *intend* to kill innocent people.
For example, the difference between *wanting* to bomb a village, versus accidentally bombing a village as your food packages have been, unbeknownst to you, replaced with bombs.

What about side-effects, e.g. unintended civilian casualties? Here, intention-based deontology invoke the [[Doctrine of Double Effect|doctrine of double effect]]. 

## Action Based Views
Morality requires you do not act in certain ways. It is not intention-free: an action involves (a) intention and (b) causing.

What about when we cause something indirectly, when we allow it to happen? E.g., letting a child drown in a swimming pool. Advocates say that actions differ from omissions:
	There is a morally significant difference between actively causing harm, and allowing harm to happen by omission.

There are other ways of affecting the world:
**Redirection**: re-directing a pre-existing threat to fewer people.
**Acceleration**: making a pre-existing threat more immanent.

## Concerns for the Agent-Focused Perspective
#### Focus on the self
More emphasis put upon one's own moral record than one's effects:
	- Consider the [[Consequentialism#Self Indulgence Objection|self indulgence objection]]
#### Dubius Distinctions
Is the distinction between action and omission really significant?
	- Consider a child drowning in a pool, who you could save, but do not.

# Patient Focused Deontology
To answer whether an action is right or wrong, we should focus on the subject. Rights provide reasons to act/not act in certain ways.

## Negative Rights
An entitlement or claim against others than they do *not* treat you in a certain way.
We have these rights in virtue of our humanity, or status as persons. This is different from political rights.

Basic rights give way to derivative rights. For example, we may have a *basic* right 'not to be used as mere means'. Therefore, we could derive a right against interrogational torture.

## Concerns for patient-focused deontology
#### Acceleration Cases
Agent-focused views permit sacrificing someone who would die anyway, however it's not obvious that patient-focused views could do the same. E.g. [[The Dynamite Case]].

#### Duties of aid
Although all kinds of deontological views are likely to struggle with this, it's especially bad for patient-focused theories. The negative right of a person could override a duty to help others.
