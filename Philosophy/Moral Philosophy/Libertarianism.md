## Liberty
It is important to distinguish between:
- Negative liberty (Absence of interference and obstacles)
- Positive liberty (power or capacity to act on one's own choices)
Libertarians are generally concerned with the former.

## Civil Liberty
Strong civil liberties are supported, such as sexual or religious freedom.

## Economic Liberty
Freedom to operate your private property (cash, capital, etc.) as you see fit. This must necessarily include [[Wage and Price Determination|wage setting]]. 
Libertarians are typically [[The Natural Rate|neoclassical]] economists, rather than [[The Goods Market#Keynesian Cross|Keynesian]].

## The State
An extremely limited role for the state is generally agreed upon.
Some institutions are seen as necessary, e.g. police, since these promote **negative liberty**.
Some other institutions, such as education or healthcare, ought to be privatised, since these only promote **positive** forms of liberty.

## Property Rights
Property rights:
- Subject to restrictions
Absolute rights:
- Subject only to the restriction that we do not do harm to others
Right of self-ownership:
- Individuals own themselves
- These rights constrain how others can treat us
- Impermissible to interfere with someone's body/property unless they are similarly violating the rights of others.
