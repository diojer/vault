# Hedonism
Well-being consists *wholly* in facts about pleasure and pain you undergo.
- If your life contains experiences of pleasure, you are benefitted,
- If your life contains experiences of pain, you are harmed.
## Advantages
- Explanatory power,
	- Most things people agree are good for us, usually bring us pleasure.
	- This things are *instrumentally* good for us.
- The experience requirement,
	- If we consider Vincent Van Gogh, who had posthumous success, did his life *go well*?
	- If we say no, we are implying that for something to contribute to an agent's wellbeing, it is required for that thing to be experienced by the agent - the experience requirement.
## Disadvantages
- The philosophy of swine objection,
	- Bentham thought that the only things that mattered w.r.t. pleasure were intensity and duration. Aside from that, all pleasures are the same.
	- Carlyle (1850) described this as a "pig philosophy", since Hedonism places all sorts of pleasure on the same level.
		- He claims that "higher-pleasures" that only humans can enjoy (traveling, learning, reading poetry, etc.) seem different in kind than "lower-pleasures" enjoyed by non-human animals.
		- Objection: There should be a pig-life of some length that you would exchange for an average-length human life, if Bentham's theory is true.
### Mill's Counter-Objection
- Pleasures of the mind are pleasures of a higher and distinct kind from pleasures of the flesh (i.e., pig-pleasures).
This is qualitative Hedonism.

This raises the question - why are pleasures of the mind "higher"?
- If it's because they're more pleasurable, we can still equate these higher pleasures to some multiple of lower pleasures.
- If it's for some other reason besides pleasure, then we are giving up hedonism.
### The Experience Machine Objection
- What is the difference?
- Nozick suggests that we want to *actually accomplish* things - we don't merely want to have the *experience* of accomplishing things.
	- Maybe then, we have to take how other people think of us/are affected by us when we are determining our wellbeing.
