At the exit of a cave, one person gets stuck. Because of this, his 5 friends cannot leave. The water level is rising, and they will all die unless his 5 friends blow him up, with their dynamite to leave.

## Potential Problems
The man is going to die immanently. So, accelerating his death for an [[Deontology#Agent Focused Deontology|agent-focused deontologist]] blowing him up is permissible. However, it is not so clear for a [[Deontology#Patient Focused Deontology|patient focused deontologist]].

For a [[Consequentialism|consequentialist]], the issue is fairly simple as 5 people being saved is better than 6 people dying.
