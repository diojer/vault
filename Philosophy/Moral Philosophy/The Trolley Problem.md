First put forward by Philippa Foot, the Trolley Problem is the juxtaposition between the [[The Trolley Problem#The Surgeon Problem|surgeon problem]] and the [[The Trolley Problem#The Trolley Problem|trolley problem]].

## The Surgeon Problem
You are a doctor with 5 sick patients all in need of an organ transplant. A healthy young man walks into your hospital. Is it permissible to steal his organs to save your five patients?

## The Trolley Problem
You are a train conductor and notice that you will run over five people on the track, unless you divert the train and instead run over one person.

Philippa Foot thought that the reason one was permissible, and the other not, is that in the trolley problem, you can either kill 5 or 1 person. In the surgeon problem, you can kill one person, or *let five die*. Letting people die must, therefore, be different from killing people (and less bad).

# Thomson's Objections
If we modified the trolley problem, so that we were instead an observer with a switch, the case becomes more similar to the surgeon problem. However, many people would still pull the lever, which seems to be contradictory with most people's response to the surgeon problem.



## Kantian Issues and the [[Doctrine of Double Effect]]
One possible reason to distinguish the surgeon and trolley problems is because in the one case, you are using the person's body as a *means to an end*, whereas in the other their death is just an unintended side-effect.
However, this factor can be removed if we imagine the trolley problem as follows:

In this case, the trolley can be diverted onto the one person, only the death of either the 5 people, or the 1 person can stop the death of the others. Therefore, the one's death is no longer a side effect, it is *necessary* to stop the deaths of the other five.

In this revised trolley problem, most people would still pull the lever, however there are basically no features distinguishing it from the surgeon problem.

## Distributive Exemption
It is possibly permissible to redirect an *existing* threat and distributing it to cause less harm. In the trolley problem, the threat already exists. However, in the surgeon problem, you are creating the threat. However, Thomson still has a problem with this:

### Footbridge Problem
There is a fairly large man standing on a bridge above the train tracks. If you push him over, his enormous mass will stop the train's momentum, stopping it before it hits 5 people on the tracks. Should you push him over?
##### Push the man:
(Experimental answers from class):
	- If he was an 'evil' person (breaks *ceterus paribus*)
	- You're responsible for the 5 people's deaths anyway, so you are either responsible for 5 deaths, or 1.
	- Timeframe is important - less time to think may make you more irrational (self-admittedly irrational)
	- Do you have a duty to convince the man to sacrifice himself?
	- Outcomes are what matter - maybe you're just having an emotional response to pushing. When we take away the emotional feeling (pulling a lever), you don't feel as bad.

At the footbridge, you still have the option to redistribute an existing threat to more people. However, it seems morally impermissible, meaning that redirection does not always make something permissible.

There are some objections to Thomson's conception of redistribution. For example, can we really claim that the one person on the track is in any more danger than the healthy man in the surgery?
