- Do Consequentialists and Deontologists care?
	- Consequentialists have a trivial way to side-step issues of collective harm, since almost by definition your act makes no difference, i.e., they do not affect the outcome. Some consequentialists will create ways to assert issues, but this is harder.
	- Deontologists might have some work to do to assert that just because no difference is made, the action isn't wrong.
# Who is in the wrong?
## General Groups
Jackson (1987) claims that it is not the fault of any one individual, but we should instead understand harm done as a result of a group. Therefore, the group is a moral agent.
### Problems
This means that we can assign moral responsibility to a certain group. Surely, in holding the group morally responsible via some kind of punishment, we are necessarily punishing individuals as well. For example, if we apply a joint punishment, like imprisonment, to the group (since it's morally responsible) we'd have to imprison each individual (who aren't morally responsible).
- You're punishing individuals as members of a group?
	- Collective punishment?
- It's not completely clear, this could be a good argument against this view.
## Certain Groups
Governments and corporations do plausibly have moral duties.
But is this an adequate response to the problem? What if it's the case that government or corporations aren't fulfilling their duties? Does the duty fall to individuals?
Also, doesn't the problem of collective action rearise - what does your attendance at a protest/signing of a petition really do to change things?
## Individuals
Everyone should do their *fair share*. Even if you don't make a difference, we each have a part we can play when acting collectively. It's unfair to rely on others' work to see to it that the collective moral objective is fulfilled.
### Problems
What if no one is currently doing *any* moral work? Cullity (2000) says no one is doing anything wrong, if this is the case.
But this gives no moral incentive to actually *start* the work fulfilling the moral objective.
Fair share is not necessarily equal share...
Do you have duty to pick up the slack of lazier people who aren't giving their fair share?
# Seminar Question
- If individuals aren't responsible, does that still leave certain collective bargaining possible?
	- Government
	- Influencers
- Problems for the legal system
	- 
- To what extent is collective responsibility convertible into individual responsibility?
