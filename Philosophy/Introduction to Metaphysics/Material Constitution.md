# Reading 1: The Statue and the Clay
Published in June of 1998 by Judith Jarvis Thomson
## Section 1
1. At 9am, I buy 10 portions of clay. We call this amount of clay CLAY.
2. At 12pm, I make a statue of King Alfred the Great out of the clay.
3. At 2pm, I put this statue on the table. We call this statue ALFRED.
4. How are ALFRED and CLAY related to each other? Easy solution:
	1. Identity thesis: ALFRED=CLAY
There are some problems with the identity thesis. CLAY existed at 9am, but ALFRED did not.
So, ALFRED and CLAY are clearly related, they currently occupy the same space, and have the same shape, size, colour, texture, and smell, etc.
Thomson suggests that opponents of the identity thesis claim CLAY *constitutes* ALFRED, but constitution is poorly defined. She also raises the following problem:
1. CLAY and ALFRED are two different things
2. CLAY is a statue on the table at 2pm
3. ALFRED is a statue on the table at 2pm
4. There are two different statues on the table at 2pm occupying the same space.
This sounds false.
So, Thomson says it could make more sense to agree with the identity thesis, and to counter the above problem mentioned:
- A) ALFRED has been in existence as long as CLAY has been, though of course ALFRED, viz., CLAY, did not become a statue until noon.

Thomson continues. Suppose that Mary got married at noon: her marrying didn't make a wife come into existence, it merely made her become a wife.
So, there are things called temporary properties, like being a wife, teenager, student, hungry, round, or red. There is a specific kind of temporary property, a *shape-constrained* temporary property.
Thomson shows that these are important: if we collect multiple portions of clay and form them into one piece of clay, she argues we did not make a piece of clay come into existence; rather, we made the portion of clay become the piece of clay. If the piece is mound-shaped, we have also made a mound of clay.
Thomson argues that being a statue should be seen as a shape-constrained temporary property.
## Section 2
Thomson details another, stronger argument against the Identity Thesis.
1. Suppose that just before 3PM I break off ALFRED's left hand, replace it with a new one, and throw the old one on the floor.
2. CLAY is not wholly on the table at 3PM
3. ALFRED is wholly on the table at 3PM
If 2.2 and 2.3 are true, then the Identity Thesis is false. This is the replacement argument.
Thomson argues that 2.2 should definitely be accepted.
2.3 seems true, and Thomson draws on cars for an example. Even if a thief steals a windshield wiper from your car, you can get it replaced and your car is still *it*, i.e., it is still the same car. So, Thomson thinks we should agree with 2.3 and reject the Identity Thesis. However, she declares some caveats:
1. Artifacts can undergo replacements of parts, but they cannot undergo replacement of too large a part all at once.
	1. If the thief steals everything *except* the windshield wiper, and you replace everything stolen, it isn't the same car.
	2. How large is too large?
2. Ship of Theseus argument: imagine we completely replace a car slowly, piece by piece. But, unbeknownst to us, our neighbour was collecting all of our discarded pieces and rebuilt them. Surely our neighbour, not us, has the original car.
	1. Imagine we replace all the parts of a 1977 Chevrolet with all the parts of a 1947 Buick. Has one become the other? Thomson also brings up the fact that we could've just moved the Buick into the space formerly occupied by the Chevrolet, which raises the important question: is it the intentions that matter?
Thomson doesn't try to answer these questions, simply supposing that artifacts can undergo replacement of a small part and remain the same artifact. So, she supposes that ALFRED remained wholly on the table after the replacement of his left hand. CLAY did not. So, they are related, but not identical. Thomson calls the relationship "constituting".
