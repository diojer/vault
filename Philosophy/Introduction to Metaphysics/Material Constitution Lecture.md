Lecture of [[Material Constitution]]
# Statue and Clay
## Background
- Two different material objects cannot be in exactly the same place at exactly the same time
	- Seems generally correct
		- Since material objects take up space, two objects would have to take up each other's space.
	- This is called "colocation".
- Objects have properties,
	- A cat and dog can both have white paws
- Objects have identity
	- Numerical identity between two objects means those two objects are exactly the same as each other.
		- For example, Batman and Bruce Wayne have numerical identity
		- If two objects have numerical identity, they cannot have different properties, i.e., Batman cannot be born in March and Bruce Wayne cannot be born in February.
	- If you can take two objects and establish some properties not in common, they cannot be numerically identical.
## Clay and Statue
- Lump of clay on Will's table, we'll call Lump.
- By noon, Will have shaped the clay into a statue, we'll call David
Are Lump and David two different objects or the same?
- Burke's arguments:
	- Lump can survive being squashed, David cannot.
### First Argument for Colocation
- Lump and David have two different properties:
	- Lump can survive being squashed, David cannot
- So, Lump $\neq$ David
- At noon, Lump and David are located in the same place
- So, there are two different objects located at exactly the same place.

The view that colocation is possible, with two objects made of exactly the same thing, is pluralism.
- Also known as multi-thingism (Bennett 2004), constitutionalism (Olson, 2001), the two object view (Ney, 2014)

This is contrasted with monism, which holds that the statue is identical to the lump
#### Criticisms
- If colocation *is* possible, why can't I walk through walls?
	- You do not constitute the walls you're trying to walk through
- Double mass: if we put David on the scale, we also put Lump on the scale. However, the scale doesn't read double the mass.
	- They share the mass: the weight of one is the weight of the other.
- The Grounding Objection
	- What explains their different persistence conditions?
		- Cannot be simply explained by appealing to their difference as "kinds of things", for example, Lump is a lump whereas David is a statue, because the problem becomes: why are they different "kinds"?
##### Dominant Kinds
There is a split in identity of the line that connects the lump of clay on the desk at 9am, and the lump of clay on the desk at 12pm. 
The Dominant Kinds view splits the lump of clay's identity into several different lumps, and reasserts the identity thesis, that David = Lump of clay in the same place as itself.
However, this raises the question:
- How does the second lump have a different persistence condition than the first lump?
	- There are dominant kinds:
		- Lump 1 is a member of just one kind: it is just a lump of clay
		- Lump 2 is a member of two kinds: it is a lump and a statue. The kind "statue" dominates the kind "lump" and thus has the persistence condition of the dominant kind.
This doesn't seem consistent:
- Lump 1 didn't survive being squashed into a statue, instead it went out of existence and became Lump 2.
- How can we explain why some kinds dominate?
