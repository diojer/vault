# Biological Individuals
- There are many different kinds of biological individuals
	- Two prominent types:
		- Evolutionary/Darwinian
		- Physiological
	- Common sense examples:
		- Adult human
		- snake
		- oak tree
	- Features shared:
		- Independent existence (one ceasing to exist does not mean another does)
		- Distinct spatiotemporal boundaries
		- Integrated causal system
			- Cohesion, collaboration, agency of parts
- Edge cases
	- Many organisms are dependent, not independent
		- Humans are dependent on gut bacteria
	- Some organisms have a continuous external, not distinct, spatiotemporal boundaries.
		- Portuguese Man O'war
			- Different parts are actually classified as different organisms and species (AKA zooids)
			- "A colony of numerous organisms called polyps that are so specialised they cannot live without each other"
# Pregnancy
## Container View
The foster, i.e., embryo, is contained in, but not a part of, the gravida, i.e., the pregnant being.
- The foster and gravida are distinct biological individuals.
- Smith and Brogaard (2003)
	- The human foster is an independent substance that fulfils the metaphysical criteria of individuality.
		- In other words, it is certainly not an edge-case, so there is no need to investigate further.
	- The foster is not specifically dependent on the gravida, merely a "similarly appropriate environment"
	- Problems with the view:
		- Topological connection?
## Parthood View
Foster is part of the gravida
- In pregnancy there is a single biological individuals
	- Similar to how organs are related to the organism they are a part of
	- Kingma (2019)
		- The foster is part of the gravida insofar as it fulfils the criteria of parthood: metabolic and functional integration, topological continuity, and immunological tolerance
	- Pradeu (2016)
		- "Any entity that interacts regularly with the immune system and is not eliminated by it is part of the physiological individual"
			- Problems:
				- It's true the foster is not eliminated but there is as much separation as possible to avoid this
					- Same with gut bacteria
					- Human parasites thrive in these same environments
	- Problems:
		- Parts are supposed to have functions for the main organism - what is the function of the foster?
			- Reproduction and fitness
