- Natural selection explains adaptation: the form, function, and design of organismal traits that make them suited to their immediate environment.
- Sexual selection is "any selection that arises from fitness differences associated with non-random success in the competition for access to gametes for fertilisation."
	- Essentially, sexual selection results in differences between sexual mates, and differential success in attracting mates.
	- Sexual selection is meant to explain sexual dimorphism.

- A puzzle arises: sexually dimorphic traits appear maladaptive
	- Isn't the male easier for predators to spot?
# Forms of competition
- Contest competition
	- Typically through direct combat
	- Mechanism looks a lot like natural selection
	- Plausible story: male rams have big horns as it is easier to exclude rivals
- Mate choice
	- Males are not excluding each other
	- Producing traits that the opposite sex finds attractive
- Scramble competition
	- "Get there first" competition, sensory and locomotory organs are developed to quickly find mates.
- Endurance rivalry
	- Outliving mates
- Gamete competition
	- Larger numbers of sperm, large size of eggs, etc.,
	- Or avoiding gamete competition, like mate guarding or "mating plugs"
- Cryptic mate choice
	- Trait is chosen after mating

Mate choice is the one that is most puzzling, since it can seem maladaptive and expensive.
# Two Views of Sexual Selection
Prum (2012) discusses two views:
- Utilitarian,
	- Subsumes sexual selection into natural selection,
	- Sexual dimorphic traits signal underlying beneficial qualities
		- E.g., a peacock must have access to a lot of food to produce so many feathers, strong rams increase survival odds
		- It seems maladaptive, which is why it is attractive, i.e., if a peacock has lived so long even with maladaptive traits, it must have very good survival skills etc.,
			- Question: why would a female mate with a male like this, considering there is more risk than mating with a less attractive male: your child will certainly not have maladaptive qualities and so will not need.
- Arbitrary
	- Arbitrary aesthetic preference
	- Intersexual traits must be perceptual
	- Traits must undergo comparative evaluation
		- This is the main divergence between utilitarian and arbitrary views
		- Utilitarian argues the signal encodes underlying beneficial traits,
		- Arbitrary theorists argue the signal is a neutral process that may or may not include trait assessment
## Testing Aesthetic Evolution
A central contention in the Darwin-Wallace debate is whether it is better to *define away* the possibility of arbitrary mate choice by subsuming all selection under the mechanism of natural selection.
- E.g., selections may start as arbitrary, but any maladaptive arbitrary aesthetic preferences will not be selected for.

Why should we give weight to arbitrary selection, which seems arbitrary, in an environment where all animals live in essentially extreme scarcity?

- Prum (2012) argues that natural selection should only be proposed if an LK null model has been falsified.
- On the other hand, the utilitarian approach does have more parsimony and value-neutrality.
