# Conventional Thought
- The conventional definitions are that health is *normal* while disease is *abnormal*,
This view runs into a few problems:
- The average height of, e.g., basketball players is highly abnormal but we wouldn't agree they have a disease
- Left-handedness is also very abnormal
- There are also many diseases that are quite common, like tooth decay
# Normativism
Concepts of health and disease are purely normative - whenever we say whether something is healthy or diseased we are just saying whether it has conditions we consider good or bad.
- Supported by the evolution of homosexuality's status as a disease
Problems:
- Anthropocentricity
	- Doesn't this just work for humans? We also think about plant diseases
		- To be fair, we only care about plant diseases insofar as they affect
		- For example: corn smut is clearly seen as a disease even though it's also seen as beneficial for humans - are the ears of corn making the call for us?
# Naturalism
Health and disease has nothing to do with normativity.
- Illness seems to rely more on normative language/judgement
Disease is when functions are impeded.
## Functions
"a standard causal contribution to a goal actually pursued by the organism".
- The organism itself doesn't have goals, but each subsystem has an empirically determined goal.
## Problems
- Are we just returning to statistical normality? Wouldn't empirical observations use statistical notions?
	- No - normality is not defined by what is prevalent, it is what we can deduce from the natural design, the result of natural selection.
	- The subsystem just has to be in "perfect working order".
- However, this could run into other problems
	- Is it a disease to have some kind of implant which *improves* us?
		- This would mean we are not in "perfect working order" - if we say "no", why? It might lead back to normativist explanations.
	- Could we arguably add, e.g., glasses, into our "system"?
- Functionalist language
	- Using natural selection to ground worldview is highly contentious,
	- The "name of the game" is variation, take sexual dimorphism for example - are the males/females all diseased?
	- To get out of this, Boorse introduces a concept called a "reference class"
		- The reference class is a natural class of organisms of uniform functional design - for example, male and female peacocks are different reference classes.
		- A normal function is whether, for the members of the reference class, a part or process aids survival and reproduction
		- A disease is a type of internal state which is either an impairment of normal functional ability
		- Health is the absence of disease
	- This seems like a regression back to the conventional view, but splits up groups so that "counting" or "modal inference" makes sense.
- Psychiatric conditions usually do not have a neuro-typical marker but are still classed as diseases,
- 
# Pluralism/Hybrid
A healthy condition is a good condition that satisfies at least one other descriptive property, and vice-versa
- This combines normative and naturalist theories
However, it doesn't seem fair to pair malfunction with bad, or function with good, in and of itself. They can come apart (such as in homosexuality).
