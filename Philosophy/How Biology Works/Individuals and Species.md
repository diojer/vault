# Aristotelian Essentialism
- Things which connect different species are universal across the species.
	- These essences are unique
		- Only dogs, for example, have a special unique essence which makes them dogs
	- These essences are sufficient for membership
In other words, species are *kinds* unified by a common essence
- Organisms belong to a species
# Species as Individuals
Individuals vs classes
- The class of red things
	- Has many members, which may or may not interact with one another
	- The members need not be spatially or temporally contiguous
- A red lobster
	- Has many parts, which typically interact with other parts
	- The parts form a spatiotemporally contiguous and bounded whole
# The New Biological Essentialism
- Species are classes defined by an essence
	- Unlike Aristotelian Essentialism, the essence is relational rather than intrinsic.
	- Genealogical relations are an example of such an essence.
However,
- These relations do not explain and predict typical traits, like Aristotelian essences are supposed to.
- So, relational essences might differ too much from Aristotelian essences to be called essences.
## Difficult Cases
- Swamp people have no lineage
- Artificially created life

1. What are some of the approaches to species?
	1. Biological species concept
		1. A group of organisms that can interbreed with each-other to reproduce
		2. Doesn't seem to account for asexual reproduction (would they all be separate species?)
	2. Morphological
		1. Visual similarities can group a species,
	3. Phylogenetic
		1. All descendants of a particular ancestor are species
		2. Seems to arbitrarily pick an ancestor
2. What are some approaches to species pluralism, what does Ereshefsky say about them?
	1. If you can't speciate all organisms using one set of criteria, that casts doubt on the reliability of species as a single category, or makes the idea of multiple possible specie concepts favourable.
3. What is the heterogeneity argument. and how does "anti-realism" argument relate to it?
	1.
