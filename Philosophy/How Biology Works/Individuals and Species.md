# Aristotelian Essentialism
- Things which connect different species are universal across the species.
	- These essences are unique
		- Only dogs, for example, have a special unique essence which makes them dogs
	- These essences are sufficient for membership
In other words, species are *kinds* unified by a common essence
- Organisms belong to a species
# Species as Individuals
Individuals vs classes
- The class of red things
	- Has many members, which may or may not interact with one another
	- The members need not be spatially or temporally contiguous
- A red lobster
	- Has many parts, which typically interact with other parts
	- The parts form a spatiotemporally contiguous and bounded whole
# The New Biological Essentialism
- Species are classes defined by an essence
	- Unlike Aristotelian Essentialism, the essence is relational rather than intrinsic.
	- Genealogical relations are an example of such an essence.
However,
- These relations do not explain and predict typical traits, like Aristotelian essences are supposed to.
- So, relational essences might differ too much from Aristotelian essences to be called essences.
## Difficult Cases
- Swamp people have no lineage
- Artificially created life
