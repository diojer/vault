# Adaptations
An adaptation is a:
- Process - a change in traits of an individual to become better suited to its environment
- Outcome - a trait that results from the process of adaptation

Adaptations are:
- Not necessarily adaptive,
	- Adaptiveness is always relevant to an environment
	- If the environment changes, what was adaptive may become maladaptive
		- e.g., our preference for high-calorie and salty foods

Two kinds of adaptation:
1. Phylogenetic/evolutionary
	- Develops over successive generations, e.g., hands, fingers, livers, etc.,
2. Ontogenetic adaptation
	- Develops in a single individual over its lifetime, e.g., calluses, muscle growth, etc.,

For example: muscle growth is an ontogenetic adaptation, but the mechanism for muscle growth is a phylogenetic adaptation.

# Adaptationism
1. (It is useful to presume that) most adaptive traits are evolutionary adaptations
2. (It is useful to presume that) natural selection is the most important process by which evolutionary change occurs.
## Criticisms
Gould and Lewontin (1979) argue adaptationists ignore how constraints and pathways are an important mediator of evolutionary change.
- "The constraints themselves become more interesting and more important in delimiting pathways of change than the selective force that may mediate change when it occurs"

They lay out the following elements of adaptationists:
1. Organisms are atomised into 'traits'. Each trait is explained primarily in terms of natural selection.
2. Any suboptimality of a trait is explained it terms of trade-offs. Natural selection optimises each trait to best contribute to the fitness of the whole.
Gould and Lewontin argue that adaptationists acknowledge, but do not seriously consider, the role of constraints. They point out the following problems:
1. When one adaptive explanation fails, another is proposed in its place (or another is assumed to exist)
2. Adaptationists attribute a lack of a potential adaptive explanation to imperfect information about historical selective environments
3. Adaptationists emphasise the immediate utility of a form to the exclusion of other structural explanations

Essentially, the bar for adaptive explanations are too low: it must merely be plausible and consistent with natural selection.

Gould and Lewontin outline alternatives:
1. It is possible that a given trait is not an adaptation and was not a product of selection
2. A trait may be the result of selection "elsewhere"
	- e.g., feathers were likely first selected to regulate heat and were later used in flying
3. Decoupling: it is possible to have selection without adaptation and adaptation without selection

There are three kinds of adaptation:
1. Empirical adaptationism
	- Natural selection is ubiquitous. It is very often possible to explain and predict evolutionary processes by only considering natural selection. Other processes can usually be ignored.
	- Natural selection is ubiquitous
1. Methodological adaptationism
	- The best way to explain and predict evolutionary processes is via natural selection. It is often a good idea to presuppose that a trait is an adaptation.
	- Natural selection is the best way to approach a problem
1. Explanatory adaptationism
	- The "big question" is why organisms are usually so well adapted to their environments, and the "big answer" is the process of natural selection.
	- Apparent design and adaptedness are the most important biological problems

### Example: female orgasm
- Adaptationist explanation:
	- Promotes pair-bonding
	- Increases probability of fertilisation
	- etc
- Non-adaptationist explanation:
	- Male orgasms are required for fertilisation, and the tissue for this develops early on, before sex-differentiation,
		- So, maybe female orgasms are "hitch-hikers" that exist because of constraints in human development.

### Other non-adaptive explanations
- Pure chance!
	- Most traits are neutral, so natural selection cannot act on them.
- Founder effect (e.g. animals arriving in Madagascar)

### Problems with Methodological Adaptationism
1. Encourages biologists to look for more "just so" stories which aren't adequately tested
2. Encourages methodological stagnation,
3. Why restricted to one explanatory method?
# Seminar
1. See earlier
2. Relation between three kinds of adaptationism:
	1. All three are logically independent
	2. 
3. What role does evidence and testing play in each of these kinds?
4. What is the philosophical component of explanatory adaptationism?
	1. Big question!
5. Do Gould and Lewontin implicitly have one of the three kinds of adaptationism in their mind during their critique?
	1. Yes - seems like they have methodological adaptationism in mind. Especially considering the way they say that adaptationists always look at problems in an inverted manner, considering adaptation as a given.
