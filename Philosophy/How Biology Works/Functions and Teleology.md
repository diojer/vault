Manufactured objects have functions because they were designed for something. They are for something because they were designed for that purpose, e.g., the function of a can opener is to open sealed cans.

Functions are also used to explain why something is in the containing system.

A teleological explanation appeals to the purpose of the thing, e.g.
 - Why is the sign there?
	 - Teleological: to tell you where to go
	 - Causal: because someone put it there
# Problems
## Problem 1
To explain by teleology/purpose is to explain by reference to something that comes *after* the existence of the thing. This suggests backward causation: goal-directed explanations use the effects of the traits to explain why they exist in the first place.
However, this supposes an agent with intentions.
In common manufactures items, this is not a problem. In natural selection theory, this becomes a problem.
### Solutions
1. Eliminate functional language - "functions" are replaced with "effect", "outcomes", etc.,
	1. Hempel rejects this move - biological entities may have multiple effects, but not all of these have equal explanatory importance.
2. Provide analysis of function that preserves its explanatory role while avoiding improper teleological implications
	1. "The function of a biological trait are those things it does, or effects it has, for which it was *selected*"
		1. What about novel traits?
		2. What about swamp people?
		3. Cummins Critique:
			1. Natural selection does not produce the variation, it only explains why proportions of variants are fixed in a population. These variations originate from mutations.
			2. When an anatomical structure is explained, it has nothing to do with its history
3. Cummins' preferred approach: Causal-role functions
	1. The role of functions is to account for the capacity of containing systems.
	2. Function-ascription is only appropriate against a background of an analysis of the capacities of the containing system,
	3. Criticisms
		1. This is still historical, because the process of natural selection will give a background of analysis
		2. The role of the heart in circulation is part of a selection story
			1. Why does the heart have the capacity it does rather than some other capacity
