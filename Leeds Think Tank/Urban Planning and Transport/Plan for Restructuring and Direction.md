1. Policy aims the Leeds City Council, WYCA, and Mayor of Yorkshire want to achieve with a new tram network
	1. Net-Zero, or, at the very least, a reduction in carbon emissions.
	2. Reduction in travel times to the city centre
		1. Have map showing current travel times to the city centre
		2. 
	3. Economic growth
		1. Labour market effects - easier to connect people who want to work with jobs that need them, i.e., lower barriers to entry; 
		2. Land use - new transport networks can stimulate extra housing but it's very important to pair them with concrete plans; "regeneration of south Leeds would bring 2,700 new jobs and 78 new businesses"
		3. Multiplier effect - In Chesterfield, regenerating brownfield led to 2,700 new jobs; a new station opening on the Leeds-Bradford "led to improvement in employment levels"
		4. (Aside) Looks like there is weird overlap between multiplier effects and land use improvement
2. How a tram network will fulfil these policy aims
	1. Net-zero benefits
	2. More efficient land use
3. The optimal tram-line
	1. Map showing optimal tram line
	2. Explanation of model we used
		1. How does the model relate to the literature
	3. Cost effectiveness
		1. Are there different lines that could be more cost effective?
