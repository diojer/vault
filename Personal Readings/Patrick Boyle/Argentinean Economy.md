# Promises
- Close central bank
- Shut down multiple departments
- Dollarise economy
	- Doesn't make long-term sense
		- No control over monetary policy
		- In the late-90s when Argentina pegged to US dollar, a surge in value of dollar made Argentinean exports uncompetitive
	- Only reason a country should dollarise is if they have no faith in policy-makers
	- Milei points to reforms created by President Menem
		- Hyperinflation brought under control by pegging peso to dollars and setting up a currency board
		- Milei criticises this approach for keeping pesos in circulation
			- Peg could eventually be reversed, happened in 2002
	- Argentines swap all pesos for dollars, no turning back
		- Peso is a failed currency
	- Most Argentineans conduct transactions in dollars
	- Mechanisms
		- Government buys back its own currency using US dollars
		- Dollars are set as the standard for all transactions by the government
		- Tax liabilities are set in dollars
	- Government no longer able to print money to finance deficits, gov. can no longer spend money not paid for by taxes
		- No backing away from austerity
	- Most economists say dollarisation is unworkable, because Argentina has no access to dollars in the central bank (-5bn)
	- Central bank loses its role as lender of last resort, no longer able to stabilise runs on deposits
		- Becomes simply a financial regulator
		- There are a few countries around the world with no central bank, but they are small
		- 
- Legalise sale of organs
- Eliminate gun laws
- Intends to privatise anything that can be in private hands
- Economic shock therapy
	- Ending price controls
	- Privatising state-owned enterprises
	- Stop gov. subs
	- Tighter fiscal policy
# Argentinean Economy

	- At the time GDP per capita was comparable to Western Europe
- Decline began in 1930s
	- Military Junta took power
- Small banking system for the size of its economy
	- Has difficulty financing deficits domestically
		- Why its external deficit is so high
			- But, because of its small export sector, doesnt have enough foreign exchange to service debt
			- Argentinean neighbours have more foreign currency reserves
- Cato Institute
	- Argentineans held about 50% of the GDP in dollars
	- Dollarisation could work if it was done gradually
		- Ecuador and El Salvador

# Argentineans
- Voted for Milei in spite of his crazy shit
# Peronism
- Over the last 20 years,
	- Doubled the size of the public sector
	- Introduced expensive subsidies
	- Tight regulation
- Draws most of its support from labour unions and poorer people
- Draws from Peron's policies
	- Social justice

- In favour of economic isolationism
	- Protects workers
	- Exports have fallen as a percentage of global exports
- Government spending is a massive problem
	- more than 1/3rd of all workers work for gov
	- Energy and transport subsidies have weakened Argentina's fiscal capacity
		- Government spent $12.5bn subsidising electricity
		- Bankrupted the country
		- If electricity is being sold too cheaply, there's no profit incentive to increase generation, and no money to pay to maintain the network
			- Energy is not efficiently used
		- Politicians did this to protect against inflation, but the subsidies are so expensive the government had to print money to pay for them, fuelling further inflation.
- Argentina taxes exports
	- If a farmer exports soybeans, they get taxed at 33%
	- They have to convert the dollars they receive into pesos, which is 1/3 the rate they could get on the black market
	- To incentivise exports, government gives better rates to soy exporters, known as the Soydollar rate

- Malbec Dollar
	- Rate designed to boost wine exports

	- Both are outsiders
	- Milei is more of a libertarian whereas Trump is a protectionist
		- Supports unilateral free trade
		- Tariffs should not exist
		- Strongly opposed to Putin
	- More in line with Ronald Reagan
	- Calls Margeret Thatcher one of his political heroes
		- Weird because he is a populist whereas Margeret Thatcher is almost the antithesis to populism, but both have very similar economic policies
- Inspired by Rothbard, Friedman and other libertarian Chicago-school economists
