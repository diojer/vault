>Increases in productivity have typically been associated with increases in compensation for employees. This is reflected in mainstream marginal productivity theory. Since the 1970s, productivity and compensation have steadily diverged.

# Different Sectors' Compensation and Productivity

- Productivity outpaced compensation in 83/183 industries.
- The distance from the industry (dot) to the equal growth rate (red line) indicates the difference between the two measures.
- The **largest difference** occurred in IT related industries.
# Different Price Deflators
- Compensation is calculated in real terms,
	- Nominal values are adjusted to exclude inflation - this inflation is typically calculated using the Consumer Price Index.
- Using the CPI as a deflator shows the change in workers' purchasing power compared to productivity.
However, the CPI may not be the most appropriate deflator to use when comparing productivity and compensation.
- Marginal productivity theory does not link wages to purchasing power (i.e., the general price level), but output (i.e., the value added to production).
	- If we deflate based on output prices, rather than consumer prices, it paints a better picture of the relationship between productivity and compensation.
	- In other words, by deflating using output prices we can better see whether labour's *share of output* has kept up with productivity, rather than seeing *how purchasing power has changed with productivity*.
- Each industry has its own unique output deflator that matches the goods and services produced in that industry.
>By using an output deflator rather than a consumer price deflator, the compensation workers receive is rising more in line with productivity.

- For example, the labour share in wholesale trade increased on the whole, but this would not be observed if using CPI-adjusted inflation.
>The labour share of income declined in 77% of industries. This means that a growing share of income was going to factors other than employee compensation over the period studied (1987-2015)
>>Factors of production include labour, capital (machinery, software), intermediate purchases (raw goods, services and energy).
>>Income may also be distributed as profit to shareholders.
# Large Productivity-Compensation Gaps
![[Pasted image 20241004130400.png]]
- Much of the change in the highest productivity industries is mostly due to a difference in deflators, rather than a fall in labour's share of income.

The relationship between productivity and the change in labor share was much weaker than the relationship between productivity and the productivity-compensation gap.
- Among the highest productivity industries, the difference in deflators was the strongest effect.
- In others, the change in labour's share of income was stronger.
- 17% of industries saw compensation rise at least as fast as productivity.
	- These tended to be industries with below average productivity growth.
	- Their median productivity growth since 1987 was 0.4%, compared with the median change (of industries that saw compensation rise slower than productivity) of 1.9%.

# Why is the labour share declining?
>77% of industries have seen the labour-share decline since 1987.

Where is the income being diverted to?
- Intermediate purchases,
- Capital.
>The largest decline in labour-share were newer, IT-related industries.![[Pasted image 20241004131348.png]]

The reason for this decline likely varies by industry. Some possible reasons:
1. Globalisation - offshoring shifts income from labour to intermediate purchases.
2. Increased automation - industries becoming more capital-intensive will shift income from labour to capital maintenance and purchasing.
3. Faster capital depreciation - it is possible that capital in these industries depreciates at a faster rate (e.g., computer hardware and software). This shifts income from labour to capital.
