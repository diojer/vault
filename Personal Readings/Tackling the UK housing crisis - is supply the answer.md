# Summary
- House prices have risen over 160% in real terms since the middle of 1996.
	- Home ownerships remain around the lowest level for a generation.
- There is a consensus that undersupply is the issue.
- However, housing stock is rising faster than the number of households
	- This is true for the entire country, but also regions like London and the South East.
	- We shouldn't compare house ***building*** with projected household formation, because the latter focuses only on new houses being built and omits other additions to the housing stock.
- Is affordability a problem?
	- Rents have been rising slower than median household incomes since 2005. Rent prices will typically reflect conditions in the housing asset market, so this also meshes with the idea that supply is not a problem.
		- Surely if this is true we'd be expecting real rents to fall, not just increase slowly? Affordability is not how to measure supply.
- What has been causing price booms?
	- Changes are determined by a combination of market rents and cost of capital.
		- Since late 1990s, mortgage rates have tumbled - this could cause prices to increase due to increased demand(?)
		- Credit availability has improved
		- Main driver has been growing demand for London housing assets, but not growing demand to live there.
