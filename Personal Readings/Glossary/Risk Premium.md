When investing in a risky asset, investors will want a higher interest rate to reflect the cost of the risk they're taking on. This is the risk premium.

For example, when investing in a very risky asset which is likely to default, investors will first want the rate of return to be at least equal to the [[Safe Rate]]; even if it is equal to the safe rate, investors will want a higher return to make up for the possibility of a future default and lost future earnings.
