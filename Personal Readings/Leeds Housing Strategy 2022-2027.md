# The Policy Context
- Grenfell tower has lead to higher regulations for the public housing sector
- Following advice from [*A new deal for social housing*](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/a-new-deal-for-social-housing) and [*A new charter for social tenants*](https://www.housing.org.uk/our-work/together-with-tenants/social-housing-white-paper/)
