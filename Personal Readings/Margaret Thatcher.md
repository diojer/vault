# 1979-1981
In the first two years of her premiership, Thatcher's rhetoric different significantly from her actions.
In general, her government had three main economic aims:
1. Lower taxes,
2. Lower government spending,
3. Lower inflation without increasing interest rates.
Thatcher's Government ended up increasing the real tax burden and real government expenditure.
## Taxes
### 1979
Despite income tax cuts, income tax receipts in stayed constant from 1978-1979. The real value of all taxes levied on Britons rose 7.5%:
- Income tax was cut: the top rate was cut from 83% down to 60% and the basic rate from 33% to 30%,
	- The top rate was applied to any income earned over £30,075 (£143,925 as of Aug 24).
	- The basic rate was applied to any income between £3,700-£12,000 (£17,706-57,426 as of Aug 24).
- VAT was raised from 12.5% on luxury items and 8% on other items to a single rate of 15%.
- Because income tax brackets were frozen, the interest rate cut was not as effective as more people entered higher brackets without earning higher real incomes.
### 1980/1
In 1980, brackets were adjusted to offset most bracket creep, but raised consumption taxes, i.e., VAT, even more. In 1981, brackets remained unchanged and consumption taxes were raised again.
### Why were consumption taxes raised?
The Conservative Government wanted to reduce the size of the budget deficit. Spending likely should have increased, as suggested by [1]. The budget deficit was likely due to recession, and an upturn in the economy would have led to higher levels of employment and more tax receipts.
### Incentives to work..?
Income tax cuts did not improve incentives to work - the real purchasing power of additional hours of work was lower for people in the basic tax bracket. However, real purchasing power did actually increase for those in the top tax bracket.
## Government Spending
Real government spending rose by 3.4% in 1979, by 1.3% in 1980 and by roughly 0% in 1981. Most of the increases in real government spending was due to two factors:
1. Increases in public sector wages,
2. Welfare payments (which had increased due to unemployment caused by the recession).

The Conservative Government was slightly successful in reducing the economic role of the government, selling shares in high-technology and service companies, as well as BP. However, in these first two years, it did not privatise or close down nationalised firms in loss-making sectors, such as coal or steel.
## Spending and Taxes
Government spending, while it increased, did not increase as quickly as taxes. Because tax revenues rose relative to government spending, the Conservative Government's fiscal policy was restrictive, deepening the recession. As [1] explains, as this fall in demand was not paired with proper supply side reforms (we will look at this later), this deepened the recession.
## Monetary Policy
The Conservative Government cemented the idea of money supply targeting as the most important way to control inflation. Interest rates were set by the market as a result of demand whereas the supply was controlled by the Bank of England, which was not independent at this time.
### Money has many definitions
The Government chose to target a broad measure of money known as Sterling M3. Sterling M3 is defined as:
- Currency in circulation,
- Sterling denominated [[Checkable Deposits]] owned by the UK private sector,
- Sterling denominated [[time deposits]] owned by the UK private sector,
- Sterling denominated deposits owned by the UK public sector,
Summed together.
### Lowering Expectations
For the FYE 1979, the targeted rate of M3 growth was 10%, allowable between 8-12%.
The allowable range was to be reduced by 1% every year, so that by 1983 the target would be 6% between 4-8%. In FYE 1978, M3 had grown by 12%, so this monetary policy was relatively tight.
