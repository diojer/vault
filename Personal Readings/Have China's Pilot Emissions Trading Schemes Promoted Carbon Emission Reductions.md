# Conclusions
## Rationale
The rationale was fair and puts this study quite far ahead of others in its field. Rather than examine province-wide carbon emissions, they specifically examined the issue from the perspective of industrial sub-sectors, rather than a province-wide perspective.
## Emission Output
Emission output reduced as a result of the emission trading schemes (ETS). This reduction was significant at the 95% confidence level in 2013 and 2015, but insignificant in the year 2014 - if we use the authors' preferred model.
## Emission Intensity
Unlike other studies, this one finds no evidence that the emissions per unit output decreased. This indicates that general production has decreased, not that Chinese manufacturers in carbon-intensive industries are developing new technology. This is generally not what we want cap-and-trade policies to encourage.
## Conclusions
ETS design should be improved to better incentivise low-carbon innovations.

ETSs are effective at reducing carbon emissions, although in China they needed some time for firms to fully understand how they worked before results started showing.
