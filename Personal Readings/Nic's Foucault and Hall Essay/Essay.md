## Foucauldian Resistance
Something I think you get a bit wrong about Foucault's notion of resistance is that it is about building/forming a new society. Foucault is very specifically against this, though.

Quotes from you:

- "While both see resistance as a means to shape the current discourse/ideology, they differ on the extent to which they believe this influence is possible."
- "While resistance could reshape the system, its (modern) disciplinary nature would make this exceedingly difficult."

Counter-quotes from Foucault (in bold because I boldened them and can't be bothered to remove lol):

- "**"Anyone who attempts to oppose the law in order to found a new order, to organise a second police force, to institute a new state, will only encounter the silent and infinitely accommodating welcome of the law." (p.38 of Madness and Civilisation)**" (This is early Foucault)
- "**Disrupting these metanarratives, as we have seen earlier, constitutes transgression, allowing society to question the limits it places. One of the most important institutions to disrupt is the judiciary, because it creates the guilt/innocence distinction. This divides the masses and impedes revolutionary activity by controlling volatile people who might spearhead a revolt. (p.232 of Language, Counter-Memory, Culture)**" (This is middle Foucault)
- So what is resistance? Is it simply that which frustrates power? Foucault sees resistance as what eludes power, and power targets resistance as its adversary (*The Will to Know, Volume One of the History of Sexuality*, p.95) Furthermore, power also creates resistance: only when power is hidden is it accepted.
	- (Not a direct quote, just paraphrase) - this is late Foucault

- (BTW I got all of these quotations from that paper I sent you by Pickett)

So, my main point here is that resistance doesn't exist to reshape the system - if it did, Foucault argues it will simply find itself again in the "accommodating welcome of the law"

There is an argument to be made, though: in the second quote, *transgression* of the judiciary seems to give rise to a *revolution* of the masses. However, it's clear that Foucault supports transgression, not revolution - the latter just reproduces the same problems of the old system. So, there is interesting discussion on which should be considered "resistance" (could be both, could just be different forms of resistance. Although revolution seems less like resistance and more offensive than defensive).

But yes, Foucault generally supports transgression against the established order. This is what makes society question the limits it has placed, and importantly, the limits it has placed on what kind of knowledge is acceptable. He wants to free the "shrieks and frenzies" of silenced voices (Madness and Civilisation, p.231). To free these, he wants an *anti-science*, because (of course), science is what is doing the silencing. So he creates genealogy.
## Foucauldian Genealogy
I feel like your description of genealogy is not quite complete in your writing:

Quotes from you:

- "His “genealogy” is a technique to map how historical eras cycled through different epistemic tools used to construct and acquire knowledge."
- "He has thought in length about the oppression of many minority groups but has offered very little insight into how one could begin to improve their situation."

Genealogy is about freeing oppressed voices from the limits placed on them by society, though, so his advocacy of transgression/pushing boundaries would arguably help the minorities he thinks are downtrodden. Also, recall that he advocated transgressing against the judicial system to make people question its validity (possibly the worst way to go about doing that lmao, I think he advocates for firebombing or something but I don't want to put words in his mouth....)

So, when you say "genealogy" is a technique to map how historical eras cycle through different epistemic tools, I kind of get what you're saying, but it seems more like a study concerning historically silenced voices. Those two sentences are almost the same, because in silencing a voice you do need to change some epistemics, but I think for genealogy the repressed/oppressed are at the forefront.
# Hall
## Hall's Power
I feel like you might be too harsh on hall for not being generalisable, however Foucault is definitely my strong-suit over Hall so take this with a grain of salt.
Quote from you:

- "However, very little is said in terms of applicable theory that can be used to make sense of other periods in History. This lack of rigour does not impoverish his work but severely limits it when attempting to make sense of power more generally."

I feel like a lot of Hall's writing in "Culture, Resistance and Struggle" is also about what *not* to do when examining a culture, which is quite applicable for other periods of history. First, you *shouldn't* try to divine a group's culture merely from their class position, this is bound to fail. Second, social factors are generally irreducible to each-other.

It's also important to remember that Hall himself values his "lack of guarantees" ([1]([Hall2.pdf (archive.org)](https://ia600703.us.archive.org/35/items/ktoub3/Hall2.pdf))) because he felt like Marxism was over-determinative. So, I get why you would disagree with that aspect, but it would be good to mention that he didn't really think it was an issue. Also, with Jonathan Dean it's best not to make such overt criticisms, I think.
# Minor Details
You wrote "As Gutting and Oksala put it in their Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry, “where there is power, there is always resistance too” (Gutting & Oksala, 2022).", but I think you could just write:
