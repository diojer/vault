# Chapter 1: Introduction
Policy makers in advanced economies face an unusual fiscal environment.
- Net debt ratios are historically high, substantially higher than they were in 2007.
- [[Deficit ratios]] are also extremely high, reflecting the lasting effects of the COVID19 crisis.
- Nominal interest rates are extremely low,
	- 3-month rates on T-bonds are typically negative,
	- 10-year rates - with the exception of the US - are very close to zero.
- Nominal rates are below expected inflation, implying negative real rates.

Because of this unusual situation, policy-makers have reached three different conclusions:
1. Due to high levels of debt, we should focus on fiscal consolidation to steadily decrease debt
2. We can suffice to stabilise the debt, and accept higher levels
3. Because of low interest rates, this is a great time for governments to borrow and finance public investment
Others have gone even farther, and argued for the cancellation of debt held by central banks.
# Chapter 2: Preliminaries
## 2.1: The neutral interest rate, $r^*$
We'll start with a simplified view of what determines interest rates, and assume that there is just one interest rate, a real interest rate. With this being the case, there are two different ways to define r*.
**First method**:
	r* can be defined as the equilibrium interest rate between investment and savings when output is equal to potential output.
	The equilibrium between investment and savings can be written as: $$S(Y,r,.)=I(Y,r,.) \tag{1}$$ where:
	- S is savings - assumed to depend on:
		- income Y,
		- the real interest rate r, (increases with r)
		- and other factors represented by the dot.
	- I is investment - assumed to depend on
		- income Y,
		- the real interest rate r, (decreases with r)
		- and other factors represented by the dot.
	For simplicity, there is no explicit government saving/spending. The investment and saving functions capture both public and private factors.
	Now, if we assume that output is equal to potential output Y*, then the equilibrium condition determines the value of the neutral rate, r*:
	![[Pasted image 20231204170624.png]]
**Second method:**
	We can define consumption $C=Y-S$ and rewrite equation (1) such that $$Y=C(Y,r,.)+I(Y,r,.) \tag{2}$$So that output is equal to aggregate demand, the sum of consumption and investment. We can define r* as the interest rate such that aggregate demand is equal to potential output.
	![[Pasted image 20231204171123.png]]
## 2.2: Safe rates and risky rates, $r$ and $r+x$
We're now differentiating between two different interest rates.
Saving depends on the [[Safe Rate]], e.g., the interest rate on government bonds.
Investment depends on the risky rate, e.g., the expected rate of return on equity.
The risky rate, r+x, is equal to the safe rate plus the [[Risk Premium]].
This modifies equation (1): $$S(Y,r,.)=I(Y,r+x,.)$$An increase in the risk premium, call it $\Delta{x}$, will consequently shift the investment curve downwards by $\Delta{x}$. This leads to a lower equilibrium, and a decrease in the safe rate by $\Delta{r}$. Because $\Delta{r}<\Delta{x}$, there is an overall increase in the risky rate.
![[Pasted image 20231204172852.png]]
This gives us another reason the safe rate may be low - an increase in the risk premium due to either an increase in risk, or an increase in risk aversion.
A similar argument can be made if we think of liquidity instead of risk, and of safer assets as more liquid. An increased demand for liquidity will lead to lower safe (liquid) asset returns, and higher risky (less liquid) asset returns.
## 2.3: The role of central banks
The role of central banks is to avoid overheating in the economy (which can lead to increased inflation) and underheating (which leads to excessive unemployment).
Since we see that the neutral rate is the rate that keeps output at potential, we can think of central banks as trying to set $r=r^*$. Whenever r* falls, the central bank will try to decrease r in line with r* and limit the drop in output.
This has two important implications:
1. While central banks cannot achieve r=r* all the time, they try to come close. So, most of the time, we can look at r as being a good proxy for r*.
2. While central banks are often blamed/congratulated for the current low rates, the blame is misplaced. The low r reflects movements in r*, and thus the factors of r* (saving, investment, risk aversion and liquidity).
## 2.4: Why is $r-g<0$ important?
The idea that r*, and consequently r, could be very low was first discussed by Alvin Hansen in 1939. He worried that investment opportunities would become so rare that a low or even negative neutral rate would be needed to generate enough demand to maintain output at potential - this was termed "secular stagnation".

As r* has decreased over the last 30 years, it has crossed two important thresholds:
1. It became less than the growth rate, g
2. It became so low that monetary policy couldn't decrease r to match - this constraint is known as the effective lower bound.
### Debt Dynamics
The first thing is to remember that all governments often issue new debt to pay for bonds which have now matured - this is known as "debt rollover".
If governments continue to rollover debt when r>g, rather than raise taxes, the debt ratio will increase exponentially at rate (r-g). If the government doesn't want the debt ratio to explode, it will have to eventually increase taxes/cut spending.
If governments rollover debt when r<g, even if they don't raise taxes, the debt ratio will decrease over time. If r<g forever, the government can spend more, issue debt and never raise taxes.
### Welfare Implications
A low r is actually a signal that something is wrong with the economy. We can view r as the *risk adjusted rate of return on capital* - since investment returns $r+x$, a low safe rate indicates that, risk adjusted, the return on capital is not very productive. Thus, the concept of debt "crowding out" private investment may not be a bad thing; it may even be beneficial if there was too much capital to start with.
### Results
This suggests that if r<g holds forever, we can take a very relaxed attitude towards debt. However, some important things to consider:
- Debts and deficits increase aggregate demand, which influences r* and consequently r. This could change the inequality.
- The inequality may not hold forever; we need to consider what r and g will be in the future.
## 2.5: Nominal and Real Rates, and the ELB
When r* is very low, it may not be possible for the central bank to set r=r*, because of the effective lower bound.
The real rate of interest is: $$r=i-\pi^e$$Where:
- r is the real interest rate,
- i is the nominal interest rate,
- $\pi^e$ is the expected rate of inflation.
If the nominal rate cannot be negative, the lowest the real interest rate can be is $-\pi^e$.

Central banks have learned that they can set slightly negative nominal interest rates without triggering a major shift to cash, because holding large quantities of cash is inconvenient, potentially dangerous and, in some cases, infeasible. So, the Zero Lower Bound was renamed to the Effective Lower Bound. This additional room, however, is small relative to the required changes in r in the past.

The ELB has two important implications:
1. If the ELB is binding, there is no room for monetary policy to increase demand and output, i.e., central banks cannot get r=r*. Thus, the burden of increasing demand to return output to potential must fall on fiscal policy.
2. If aggregate demand strengthens leading to an increased r*, the ELB may no longer strictly bind, and nominal interest rates may become positive again. However, r* is unlikely to become so high as to give the central bank more room to respond to large adverse shocks to demand in the future.
Blanchard makes a further point: while secular stagnation, i.e., a very low r*, reflects fundamental forces in the economy, the ELB is instead more of a self-inflicted wound. Had central banks chosen a higher target inflation rate, say 3% rather than 2%, nominal interest rates could be higher and there would be more room for manoeuvre from the central banks.
## 2.6: Conclusion
- To the extent that r-g remains negative, debt may not be very costly in both fiscal and welfare terms.
- While the ELB continues to bind, fiscal policy, i.e., higher deficits, may be needed to maintain output at potential
# Chapter 3: The evolution of interest rates
## 3.1: The evolution of the safe rate
![[Pasted image 20231204181609.png]]
This graph looks at the 10-year real rates for treasury bonds.
- The graph starts in 1992 because in the decade prior, the real rates were detached from the neutral rates (r$\neq$r*) because of loose monetary policy in the 1970s, which led to Volcker tightening the economy more than the neutral rate demanded.
- Treasury bonds are generally thought to reflect the safe rate,
- 10-year maturity was chosen since that is close to the average maturity of public debt, 7 years for the advanced country members of the G20.
Two major conclusions:
1. The decline is common to all three economies, suggesting that the same forces were at play in all three, but also high levels of integration between the economies
2. The decline has been steady, and is not due to the Great Recession or Covid-19.

This graph shows the change in interest rates from the 1300s to the present day.
### The Dramatic Decline in r-g
![[Pasted image 20231204183213.png]]
This graph shows the real rate (in red) and the growth rate (in blue).
### Potential Factors behind the decline in the safe rate
- Increased risk aversion
- Increased risk from more complex processes of production
- Increased demand for safe assets coming from liquidity regulation due to the Great Recession
- Reassessment of "safe" assets
- Aging population prefer safer portfolios
Determining the role of each of these factors is hard to pin down. The variable trying to be explained, r*, is not directly observable, and the ELB complicates matters.
Identifying the role of global and domestic factors is also hard. The answer is likely always a mix of the two; for example, the high savings rate China incurred during their industrialisation increased world savings and, ceteris paribus, led to a lower r* for other countries. In contrast, the temporary expansion of demand triggered by the Biden stimulus may not lead to a similar increase in other countries.
Blanchard takes steps to show that a large part of the decline in the safe rate has been due to a higher demand for liquidity on the part of financial investors.
## 3.2: Interest rates and growth rates
Blanchard starts by pointing out that the classical utility-based Euler consumption function isn't a good determinant of the growth rate - this is because the Euler consumption function
