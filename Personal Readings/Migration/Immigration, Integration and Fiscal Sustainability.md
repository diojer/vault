# Abstracti
Economic theory points out that immigration of even low-skilled immigrants may improve public finances in Western welfare states, and it is some times suggested that fiscal sustainability problems in Western countries caused by ageing populations could be solved by increasing immigration. We examine consequences of various immigration scenarios using the large-scale computable general equilibrium model DREAM describing the Danish economy. It turns out that increased immigration will generally worsen the Danish fiscal sustainability problem. Improved economic integration of immigrants and their descendants, however, may alleviate the problems of the public sector considerably.
# General Vibes
- Migrants and migrant descendants are categorised, unlike previous studies where descendants are assumed to have the same behaviour/earnings as the rest of the native population.
	- Descendants are put at about half-way between the averages of first-gen migrants and the native population.
- Migrants of lower and higher income countries both have lower average wages than the native population.
- While migrants are generally younger, the Danish data shows that they tend to claim benefits at a higher rate at all ages than the native population. 
	- Migrants from higher income countries also tend to leave earlier than those from lower income countries, meaning that the average make-up of migrants will slowly shift toward migrants from lower income countries.
		- This cancels out the positive effect of a younger population, because even though the population is younger, a higher rate of the population does not work.
- Increasing migration from lower income countries more makes public finances worse, because even though the population rises *more*, the extra population requires more transfers from the government.
- Increasing migration from higher income countries makes public finances slightly better.
