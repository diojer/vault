# Summary
- Both parties retain the free trade of goods, however there are still technical barriers to this trade, for example VAT must be paid on import rather than at the point of service.
- Services trading is based on WTO rulings, each party must treat the others' service providers as if they were their own. Furthermore, the UK cannot simply prioritise national public procurement due to WTO regulations.
- Free movement has been abolished, and the UK must negotiate cargo plane flights with each EU member state separately. 
- A committee has been assembled to resolve disputes, however if it fails the dispute is sent to an independent arbitration panel.

# Trade In Services
