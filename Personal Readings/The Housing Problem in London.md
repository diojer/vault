# The Perceived Problem - and why it is wrong
The high cost of housing in London is causing real problems. Housing costs now show up as a major concern in opinion surveys. Businesses find it more difficult to recruit at pay levels they can afford.
- [PwC's Cities of Opportunity](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/capital-projects-infrastructure/publications/assets/pwc-cities-of-opportunity-building-the-future.pdf) ranks London highly overall, but places it 26th out of 30 in terms of cost.
- [London First's Moving Out](https://www.businessldn.co.uk/sites/default/files/documents/2018-07/MovingOut_0.pdf) reported that 73% of London business decision-takers considered that London's housing supply and costs were a significant risk to the capital's economic growth.
## Cause of the Problem - Conventional Wisdom
- Shortage of land, sometimes it is said that Britain is an "over-crowded island"
- Developers don't build fast enough and sit on land hoping it will rise in value
- Decline in council house building
- Rapacious behaviour by landlords, exploiting tenants, charging high rents and evicting at will
## Why Conventional Wisdom is Wrong
"Laws of supply and demand have not and cannot be repealed".
There is evidence that if enough homes are being built house prices will fall ([source](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2017/03/09/global-house-prices))
- House prices fell in nominal terms by over a quarter between 1988 and 1993
- In Spain and Ireland, between Q1 2007 and Q4 2016, the real change in house prices was -36%.
	- -26% in Italy
	- -15% in the US
	- -4% in the UK
- In New Zealand, Canada, Germany, Australia and Switzerland, real house prices increased by over 30% in the same period.
- "The notion that prices are beyond the ability of people to pay is wrong - by definition. Prices are where they are precisely because people are willing and able to pay them - uncomfortable as that might be."
	- **Reasons how people are willing and able to pay them**:
		- Young people are remaining in the parental home for longer - 1 in 4 in London, compared with 1 in 6 in 1990.
		- Parents are contributing to children's housing costs
		- People are sharing living spaces or renting smaller properties, i.e., people are occupying less space.
		- People are paying much more for housing (duh)
		- The age at which people buy their first home has risen dramatically.
			- In the 25-34 age group, home ownership has halved since 1990. Not because owning is more expensive, rather it is actually cheaper than renting because "owners are not paying a third party to manage and maintain their housing." Instead, Boleat claims the problem is government policy regulating the mortgage market and restricting access to home ownership.
- Between 1998 and 2015 the population of London increased by 21% while the supply of housing increased by 12%. This explains why prices are rising (true).
	- Lower interest rates means the decline in affordability (at least at the point of purchase) has been less dramatic but still substantial.
### Going through the points
- **Shortage of land**
	- Urbanised areas cover 9.9% of England, the built area 4.2% and domestic housing 1.1% - green spaces cover 94.4%.
	- In London, the built area is 27.6%, housing 8.7% and and green space is 38.2%.
		- Domestic gardens account for around 30% of land use in London
	- [London First](https://www.businessldn.co.uk/sites/default/files/documents/2018-05/Green-Belt.pdf) points out that:
		- 59% of Green Belt land in London is agricultural land
		- 22% of Green Belt land is public access land or land that has an environmental designation
		- 7% of Green Belt land is golf courses
		- 65% of land in London is "green" but only 22% is designated as Green Belt
	- To be fair, the purpose of the Green Belt is mainly to limit "urban sprawl" rather than provide green space to the public. But, "this does not alter the fact that the effect of the Green belt has gone well beyond restricting urban sprawl"
- **Developers don't build fast enough and sit on land hoping it will rise in value**
	- It is true that developers do have large land banks, often running to ten years or more, and that land is traded between developers.
	- However, this isn't to say that developers trade land to make a profit.
	- Further, "holding land has a cost" and land values can fall as well as rise - in London, residential land values fell 40% between 2007 and 2009.
	- Developers need a pipeline of land because the process of buying, obtaining planning permission and building can take years
		- There are good logistical reasons for this:
			- House building is labour intensive
			- Developers do not aim to complete a large site all at the same time because the price would dip below profitability
	- The issue of land banking has been examined by official bodies, results summarised [here](https://www.hbf.co.uk/news/permissions-to-land-debunking-the-land-banking-myth/)
		- There is little evidence that land banking increases barriers to entry into the market
		- The current evidence does not support the suggestion that house builders hold land for longer than they need
		- No evidence to support the view that, at the national level, homebuilders are hoarding a large amount of land with implementable planning permission on which they have not started construction. This suggests competition has not been impaired by homebuilders mothballing permissioned land to create a barrier to entry, *even* during the long upturn in the market 'til 2007. There is equally little evidence to suggest that homebuilders have been able to systematically obtain market power at a local level by acquiring planning permission.
		- Site-by-site interviews suggest the obvious: builders intend to build, non-builders do not. So the fact that non-builders control almost half the planning pipeline is a constraint on housing development. When accusations of land banking are directed at builders, those accusations are misplaced.
		- **The following survey states where housing plots are found:**
			- ![[Pasted image 20240213021010.png]]
	- Annual report of major house builders provides additional info: especially on the issue of whether house builders make money from buying land, sitting on it and selling at profit:
		- [Taylor Wimpey's 2016 report](https://www.taylorwimpey.co.uk/corporate/investors/results-and-reports) stated that it owned 76,000 plots (five years supply) and that it had a strategic land bank (land where there was no planning permission) of 108,000 plots. 
			- In 2016 it converted 9,519 plots from strategic to short term. It completed 14,000 homes in 2016. 
			- During 2016 it recorded: house sales of £3.268bn, land sales of £48.1mn
		- [Berkeley Homes 2016 report](https://www.berkeleygroup.co.uk/-/media/migration/berkeley-group/about-us/investors/annual-report/annual-report-2016.ashx?rev=777b98733384446cac8b990616d0bf69&hash=66E157FFB5972F83F214687285782F71) stated that it owned 42,858 plots of which 9,000 were contracted but did not have planning permission.
			- Compare this with 4,000 completed plots in 2016.
			- It had a strategic land bank of 5,000 plots.
			- During 2016: house sales: £1.965bn; land sales: £2.3mn
	- **Overseas Buyers**
		- Implication: more units are sold to foreign buyers so less housing and higher prices for Londoners
			- Further implication: foreign buyers buy housing and leave it empty, expecting to profit
		- Proposed solution: preferential access to Londoners
		- Implausible in theory, but now there is evidence to disprove (apparently)
		- Homes for Londoners report, available [here](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/overseas_investment_homes_for_londoners_sub-group_report.pdf)
			- Overseas buyers bought 10% of all new homes in London between 2014-2016, although if new *affordable* homes are excluded, it rises to 13%.
			- At least 70% of overseas purchases were bought with the intention to rent out, suggesting that, overall, up to 4% of market sale homes were bought by overseas buyers and might potentially not be regularly occupied
				- Within this 4%, a spectrum of uses was defined, and the number of homes deliberately kept empty was considered negligable
			- Overseas investment in London's property market finances and de-risks investment at an early stage, helping to unlock housing supply
				- Overseas investment had a net benefit on housing supply, meaning that many times more homes were built and lived in overall than were bought and not regularly occupied
			- London attracts a significant amount of institutional investment from lenders and business globally, bring forward development on major sites faster and with more homes.
			- "Overall ... sales to overseas buyers almost certainly contributed to the net availability of housing to Londoners"
	- Final comments:
		- If it was really just the behaviour of developers, the problem would be easy to solve.
			- Local authorities and housing associations would expand their own development and use the anticipated excess profits to subsidise social housing
- **Decline in council house building**
	- It is a fact that council housing building has declined from very high levels to negligible levels, and at first sight this has contributed to the current housing problem
	- However, this requires qualification: old style council houses may have been produced in large numbers but it also produced poor quality and heavily subsidised housing that had to be financed by taxes.
		- A given capital sum can lead to higher level of house building if not used to build council houses, which have to be allocated according to bureaucratic rules and which exclude a majority of the pop.
			- This is why local councils have shifted away from council housing and use the money in "more imaginative ways" like remediating brownfield land to make private sector building viable, or financing shared ownership schemes.
- **Final Comments**
	- There are important reasons why house prices have gone up:
		- Mortgage tax relief and been abolished and council and housing association rents are much nearer a market level than was the case 30 years ago.
			- Some important subsidies remain:
				- Inheritance tax excludes owner-occupied housing
				- Most tenants of social housing receive housing benefit which in many cases pays the whole of their rent. Being given a council tenancy in some of the more desirable parts of London is the equivalent of being given a capital asset of well over £1mn - right-to-buy allows this to be realised at a later date.
		- If council tax were more related to property values then there would be a moderating effect on housing costs
	- There are some ways it has gone down:
		- Change in stamp duty to add a surcharge to buy-to-let and second homes helps to increase supply of homes.
# The Real Problem
The supply of land for housing has been artificially restricted.
To be developed for housing, land must meet four tests:
1. It is owned by a developer,
2. It is in a condition that can be built on, and the necessary infrastructure is in place or will be in place in a timely manner,
3. It has or is likely to have the necessary planning permission,
4. The housing is capable of being sold at a price that will yield an adequate return
## Councillors and Residents
### Councillors
40% of councillors in inner London and 21% in outer London reported that they would receive less support if they advocated for building more housing - the total average is around 33%. However, the role of the planning committee should be to decide whether the planning application is in accordance with their set policies, *not* to mediate between developers and objectors. Source [here](https://www.businessldn.co.uk/sites/default/files/documents/2018-07/MovingOut_0.pdf)
- The vast majority (92%) of councillors agree that there is a housing problem
- 42% of councillors in South and West London are worried about receiving less support
- 23% and 28% of councillors in North and East London are worried about receiving less support
- 58% of Conservative councillors are worried
	- 17% of Labour councillors
	- 40% of Lib Dem councillors
### Residents
Real Londoners are "Not so NIMBY" - 41% of residents in London would look on their local politicians favourably if they pushed for more housing/politicians who wanted to build homes in their local area.
- 32% said it wouldn't change how they viewed politicians
- 16% said they would view politicians negatively for building homes in their local area.
- 26% of Conservative voters (in 2010) said they would look negatively
	- 12% of Labour voters
	- 20% of Lib Dem voters
76% of public respondents think there is a housing problem, but this drops to 58% when asked if there is a problem in their area, dropping to 53% if they support more development.
- Barring central London, the proportion of people who think there is a shortage is always higher than the people who want to do something about it.
## Barriers to Development
In order to have the best possible chances of their applications getting approved, developers have to "bribe" local authorities with amenity improvements.
- This doesn't sound too bad, it's a way of incorporating social benefit into private costs
- However, it does certainly inhibit development.

There has also been an inflation with respect to the time it takes for an application being accepted.
- 1 month used to be the norm, now it is 6 months.
- This could be due to conservation or archaeological reasons
	- This is probably not too bad, the archaeology industry needs the ability to get sites.
### Planning
There are 33 separate planning parties in London.
- This creates a difficult situation for small developers who want to branch out into different boroughs.

In areas where an authority wants significant commercial development, the wisest decision to take is to have no residents, as they will have a powerful voice in planning and likely refuse new building.
- The City of London has a clear policy of not allowing residential development.
- Even if most residents would like to live in a commercial area, different considerations, like the Right to Light, makes it easy for one resident to hold up new development.
