# Intro
- Movements in long-term growth tend to be decomposed as a trend + fluctuations.
	- Conventional macroeconomics views the trend as a result of supply-side decisions while business-cycle fluctuations are typically caused by demand-side changes.
	- Because monetary policy is concerned primarily with the demand-side of the economy, it is therefore seen as ineffective in changing trend-output. This is referred to by Blanchard as the "Independence Assumption".
- The alternative view poses that trend output is itself a fluctuation of past values of current output, essentially saying that the trend level of output experiences "hysteresis", or "path dependency", and changes depending on how it is reached.
	- Evidence for hysteresis is mixed. On the one hand, the 'Great Moderation' period following the 1970s oil shocks and Volcker reforms in the US up to 2008 is often seen as evidence against the hypothesis.
	- Meanwhile, since 2008 the idea of long-run effects of monetary policy has revived, partly because of constant downward revisions to growth forecasts.
		- Some authors argue that these revisions are actually due to already low underlying trends which were masked by pre-2008 booms.
		- Other authors, notably Summers (2014), argue that it provides clear evidence of hysteresis.
- Demand-shock hysteresis is transmitted mainly through persistent unemployment changes rather than through any effect on long-run productivity, in the US.
	- Productivity stays constant likely because of countervailing forces.
		- Low-productivity workers are likelier to become unemployed during a recession - this increases productivity simply due to its definition.
		- However, reductions in investment reduce long-run productivity trends.
		- Combined, in the US, demand fluctuations have no effect on productivity.
- Supply-shocks *are* typically transmitted through productivity downgrades, on the other hand.
