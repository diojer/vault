# Summary
- "Planning for the Future" White paper by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government available [here](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/958421/Planning_for_the_Future_web_accessible_version.pdf) suggests some kind of "automatic permission" mechanism for new housing (and other forms of development). Compliant development should follow automatically without recourse to local planning committees.
	- Current English system is called "case-by-case permission"
	- Possible future automatic system called "rules-based zoning".
- Rules-based zoning is unlike any other system around the world as it will, if adopted, use existing planning instruments to deliver automatic permission.

# Introduction
The problem with the current approach is presented as follows:
- Planning decisions are discretionary rather than rules-based: nearly all decisions to grant permission are undertaken on a case-by-case basis, rather than determined by clear rules.
- This increases planning risk, pushing up costs.
- Some easing of regulations has been projected to reduce costs by at least 14% (Hilber and Vermeulen, [2010](https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/31752/)).
	- This is up to 35% with a complete lack of regulations.
	- However, a complete lack of regulations was seen as neither realistic nor desirable.
- While constraint policies, such as the green belt, conservation areas, sightlines and height limits certainly reduce supply, the effects the planning process itself has, are less clear.
	- While there is spatial variation on the *level of opposition* to new housing, the actual effect this has on output is less clear.
- The solution asserted by the government's White Paper (available [here](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/958421/Planning_for_the_Future_web_accessible_version.pdf)) is the implementation of automatic permission.

However, the presentation of zoning as the solution to the housing crisis assumes that the crisis is largely predicated on a supply shortage.
- It is true that things seem uncertain - councillors are subject to re-election and do not want to upset existing residents.
- Essentially, the case-by-case English planning system is not great at providing developers with confidence to fully commit to sites (especially so when paired with continuous democratic engagement).
	- This advantages business models that can better cope with uncertainty
- Supply is certainly a big "sub-issue", the other being demand.
So - would a shift to rules-based zoning solve the supply crisis, leaving only demand as the final problem?

Quick summary of the rules-based zoning approach:
- Democratic element of planning is still incorporated, but it is "front-loaded"
	- Plans are decided democratically, but from there democracy cannot interfere with the permissioning process
- Permissioning becomes a technical matter.
- This already exists for land listed in a brownfield register - the scheme/tool is called "Permission in Principle", essentially separating the considerations of matters of principle for proposed development from technical details of the development.

# The Housing Crisis and Rules-Based Zoning
The crisis is due to supply-side and demand-side drivers, e.g.:
- Demand-side:
	- Household formation
	- Historically low interest rates
	- Accelerating supply of mortgage credit
	- Cross-border direct investment
	- More people and institutions investing in land and housing as a source of rent income
- Supply-side:
	- Variable application of planning restriction
		- Uncertainty affects the progress of development schemes
	- Prospect of acquiring planning permission can cause land-values to spike
		- Companies may hang on to land rather than develop it, slowing housing supply
	- Less public housing available
	- Not enough construction capacity in the private sector
	- Overseas buyers?
	- We are too reliant on private sector
	- Tax treatment on housing is hindering supply, e.g., VAT on conversion
	- Increased credit supply and money creation - achieved through financial deregulation - has eased home ownership but pushed up prices out of the reach of average (and sometimes high) income households.
# Rules-based zoning, Case-by-case Permissioning, and Housing Supply
- Rules-based zoning policies are united by a common theme:
	- Development which complies with the local rule book can proceed automatically. Proponents of zoning argue that automatic permission is a source of certainty for developers.
- English planning operated on case-by-case permissioning
	- Local plans are not legally binding regulatory plans
		- Local politicians or lawmakers can exercise discretion when deciding whether or not to grant planning permission
	- The decision is never a foregone conclusion.
	- Planning in Principle (PIP) stands outside this approach,

These two systems differ in numerous ways:
- Democracy
	- In zoning, democracy is "front-loaded" in the planning section, but not the project section
		- This can lead to discrepancies between the building and local aspirations
			- Democracy may be seen as only fully carried out if the project itself can have democratic influence
			- This can result in frustration/disappointment, often fixed by introducing local discretion or by standard discretionary review for projects over a certain size.
- Flexibility and certainty
	- From the zoning perspective, case-by-case permissioning is thought the provide greater flexibility
	- From the case-by-case perspective, zoning is thought to provide greater certainty,
		- The English planning system has trialled a number of zoning tools, like PIP.
	- Zoning is thought to be more "user-oriented" and privilege the objectives of developers, while case-by-case helps to ensure that "public values shape development outcomes".
	- Compromise can balance these needs.
		- Any sudden shift to zoning based planning is unlikely to win public support.
## Permitted Development Rights
- Office blocks were allowed to be converted into housing with minimal planning interference
	- Housing supply increased
	- Quality of housing was "slum-like"
		- Report available [here](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/slums_of_the_future_-_permitted_development_conversions_in_london_by_tom_copley_am.pdf)
		- Councils couldn't enforce affordable housing levels (Section 106)
		- Homes were smaller than the nationally described minimum standard
- Many argue that the lack of case-by-case scrutiny was to blame for failure.
- Planning certainly has a function involving public-service - without accounting for public health, we are presented with our own social risks.
## Temporal and Spatial Flexibility
- Flexibility is necessary to account for changing market conditions which can render pre-approved plans unviable
	- Implementing rules-based zoning which incorporates caveats will likely fail to win public support because of uncertainty over what will eventually be built.
- Rigid prescriptions may win popular support but become impossible to utilise because of shifting market conditions.
	- The shift to more discretionary, case-by-case permissioning has been the trend in many US cities.
- Plans must be designed to deal with existing the existing business models that developers utilise.
	- "Planning systems incubate their own development models"
		- Greater uncertainty due to case-by-case systems can lead to business models which make money in the difference between application costs and the risk premiums.
			- Greater uncertainty may also depress land values as the landlord will have to bargain with a developer desiring a higher margin to account for risk.
		- Advocates of zoning argue that this risk is transferred to consumers through house prices and subsequent rents.
## Compare with US and Australia
- These countries have rules-based zoning
- Case-by-case permissioning results in fewer, larger development firms
- In the US and Australia, land developers can buy land in areas zoned for residential use, then:
	- Connect the sites to local infrastructure networks (e.g., water, electricity)
	- Obtain development permission
	- Sell plots to smaller developers to build the houses and sell them
- Smaller developers can operate with less capital and without having to face risks and costs of:
	- Planning negotiations
	- Developing underlying infrastructure
	- Planning permission applications
- More diversified housebuilding industry.
Advocates of PIP make similar claims.
