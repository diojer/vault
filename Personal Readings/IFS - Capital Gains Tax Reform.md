- Capital Gains Tax
	- A tax levied on the increase in value of an asset between its acquisition and disposal (sale).
	- If an asset is held until death, any capital gain up to that point is subject to uplift/a step-up in basis (the tax is forgiven).
# Who Pays CGT
CGT applies only to assets sold by individuals and trustees.
- Gains made by companies are included in profits and subject to corporation tax.

Not all assets are subject to CGT.
- Exempt are:
	- Increases in the value of *owner-occupied* homes,
	- Assets held within pension funds or ISAs.
- There is relief for venture capital and employee-share schemes.

CGT is levied on gains *realised* in the UK.
- There is a grace-period for immigrants during which they are not taxed on gains made on overseas assets.
- If you leave the UK, you can avoid tax on gains accrued while they were here.

There is an annual threshold below which CGT does not have to be paid.
- This is £3,000, down from £12,300 (changed in 2022/23).
	- This is subtracted from total annual capital gains before calculating the tax due.

| Source of Gains                                                | Basic Rate | Higher Rate | Additional Rate |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| **Carried Interest**                                           | 18%        | 28%         | 28%             |
| **Residential Property**                                       | 18%        | 24%         | 24%             |
| **Business Asset Disposal (BAD) relief and investors' relief** | 10%        | 10%         | 10%             |
| **Other assets**                                               | 10%        | 20%         | 20%             |
| **Exempt assets, and all gains unrealised at death**           | 0%         | 0%          | 0%              |
Where:
- **==Carried interest==** - the share of profits from a private equity fund that is paid to private equity managers. Essentially a performance fee.
- ==**BAD relief**== - preferential tax rate for owner-managers' shares in their companies.
- **==Investors' relief==** - preferential tax rate for external investors holding shares in unlisted companies for at least 3 years (up to a lifetime limit of £10mn).
- ==**Other assets**== - Mostly made up of company shares. These are technically subject to a higher overall effective tax rate as a result of corporation tax being levied on company profits (from which shares derive their value).
	- Even accounting for this, capital gains are taxed at significantly lower rates than labour income.
# Excess and Normal Returns
Taxes have different effects depending on whether they are levied on normal and/or excess returns.
- A tax on normal returns will create a range of distortions, including discouraging saving and investing.

The normal return is the return that *just* compensates savers and investors for the delay in consumption.
- This includes no extra compensation for risk-taking.
- This means when someone buys a share, they have to *at least* make the risk-adjusted normal return in order to part with their money.
	- If the RoI is below the risk-adjusted normal rate of return, then they would just rather put it in a savings account.

RoI is usually above the normal rate, however. The returns on top of the normal returns are called "excess returns". These returns can reflect:
- Luck,
	- When something is a riskier investment, it will only be attractive with a correspondingly higher expected return (this is known as a risk premium).
- Economic rent,
	- Rents are returns greater than that required to make an investment worthwhile. These could be due to a state-monopoly (license or patent), an unregulated monopoly, asymmetrical information, brands.
- Effort and skill.
	- These excess returns could reflect skill in choosing the best investments.
	- Excess returns due to effort could also be where labour income is disguised as capital gains (e.g., where a company owner-manager pays herself in dividends or capital gains rather than through a salary).
In practice, capital gains represent a mix of sources.
# Problems with the Design of CGT
Foundational axioms:
- The tax system should be neutral - without a strong rationale, taxes should not distort commercial decisions about who holds assets for how long; which assets are chosen; and whether remuneration is taken as earnings, dividends, or capital gains.
- The tax system should not discourage saving and investment.
IFS argues that the current design of the tax system distorts all these margins. This makes it a source of ==economic inefficiency and unfairness==:

**Economic inefficiency**:
- Reduced rates of investment and skewed patterns of capital allocation will mean that, for a given level of revenue, productivity is lower. This results in lower output and income.

**Unfairness**:
- Example:
	- Take two people who have made similar investments into their own company and generated similar returns.
	- One takes the return as a flow of dividends.
	- The other takes the return as capital gains when the company is sold.
		- They use another source of income to finance their spending before the point of sale.
	- The first person faces a large and unfair tax penalty relative to the second.

These problems are exacerbated at higher rates of CGT.
- Inefficiency, created by a distorted tax base, rises more than in proportion to tax rates.
	- This is because low tax rates only change behaviour when the decision is marginal anyway (e.g. when the rate of return is almost risk-free).
	- Meanwhile, higher tax rates discourage not only *more* activities than lower rates, but also *more valuable* activities.
- Lower rates of CGT lessen the problems caused by the tax base, but they cannot fix them.
