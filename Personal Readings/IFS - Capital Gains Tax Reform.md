- Capital Gains Tax
	- A tax levied on the increase in value of an asset between its acquisition and disposal (sale).
	- If an asset is held until death, any capital gain up to that point is subject to uplift/a step-up in basis (the tax is forgiven).
# Who Pays CGT
CGT applies only to assets sold by individuals and trustees.
- Gains made by companies are included in profits and subject to corporation tax.

Not all assets are subject to CGT.
- Exempt are:
	- Increases in the value of *owner-occupied* homes,
	- Assets held within pension funds or ISAs.
- There is relief for venture capital and employee-share schemes.

CGT is levied on gains *realised* in the UK.
- There is a grace-period for immigrants during which they are not taxed on gains made on overseas assets.
- If you leave the UK, you can avoid tax on gains accrued while they were here.

There is an annual threshold below which CGT does not have to be paid.
- This is £3,000, down from £12,300 (changed in 2022/23).
	- This is subtracted from total annual capital gains before calculating the tax due.

| Source of Gains                                                | Basic Rate | Higher Rate | Additional Rate |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| **Carried Interest**                                           | 18%        | 28%         | 28%             |
| **Residential Property**                                       | 18%        | 24%         | 24%             |
| **Business Asset Disposal (BAD) relief and investors' relief** | 10%        | 10%         | 10%             |
| **Other assets**                                               | 10%        | 20%         | 20%             |
| **Exempt assets, and all gains unrealised at death**           | 0%         | 0%          | 0%              |
Where:
- **==Carried interest==** - the share of profits from a private equity fund that is paid to private equity managers. Essentially a performance fee.
- ==**BAD relief**== - preferential tax rate for owner-managers' shares in their companies.
- **==Investors' relief==** - preferential tax rate for external investors holding shares in unlisted companies for at least 3 years (up to a lifetime limit of £10mn).
- ==**Other assets**== - Mostly made up of company shares. These are technically subject to a higher overall effective tax rate as a result of corporation tax being levied on company profits (from which shares derive their value).
	- Even accounting for this, capital gains are taxed at significantly lower rates than labour income.
# Excess and Normal Returns
Taxes have different effects depending on whether they are levied on normal and/or excess returns.
- A tax on normal returns will create a range of distortions, including discouraging saving and investing.

The normal return is the return that *just* compensates savers and investors for the delay in consumption.
- This includes no extra compensation for risk-taking.
- This means when someone buys a share, they have to *at least* make the risk-adjusted normal return in order to part with their money.
	- If the RoI is below the risk-adjusted normal rate of return, then they would just rather put it in a savings account.

RoI is usually above the normal rate, however. The returns on top of the normal returns are called "excess returns". These returns can reflect:
- Luck,
	- When something is a riskier investment, it will only be attractive with a correspondingly higher expected return (this is known as a risk premium).
- Economic rent,
	- Rents are returns greater than that required to make an investment worthwhile. These could be due to a state-monopoly (license or patent), an unregulated monopoly, asymmetrical information, brands.
- Effort and skill.
	- These excess returns could reflect skill in choosing the best investments.
	- Excess returns due to effort could also be where labour income is disguised as capital gains (e.g., where a company owner-manager pays herself in dividends or capital gains rather than through a salary).
In practice, capital gains represent a mix of sources.
# Problems with the Design of CGT
Foundational axioms:
- The tax system should be neutral - without a strong rationale, taxes should not distort commercial decisions about who holds assets for how long; which assets are chosen; and whether remuneration is taken as earnings, dividends, or capital gains.
- The tax system should not discourage saving and investment.
IFS argues that the current design of the tax system distorts all these margins. This makes it a source of ==economic inefficiency and unfairness==:

**Economic inefficiency**:
- Reduced rates of investment and skewed patterns of capital allocation will mean that, for a given level of revenue, productivity is lower. This results in lower output and income.

**Unfairness**:
- Example:
	- Take two people who have made similar investments into their own company and generated similar returns.
	- One takes the return as a flow of dividends.
	- The other takes the return as capital gains when the company is sold.
		- They use another source of income to finance their spending before the point of sale.
	- The first person faces a large and unfair tax penalty relative to the second.

These problems are exacerbated at higher rates of CGT.
- Inefficiency, created by a distorted tax base, rises more than in proportion to tax rates.
	- This is because low tax rates only change behaviour when the decision is marginal anyway (e.g. when the rate of return is almost risk-free).
	- Meanwhile, higher tax rates discourage not only *more* activities than lower rates, but also *more valuable* activities.
- Lower rates of CGT lessen the problems caused by the tax base, but they cannot fix them.

With the current tax base, CGT discourages different investments to different degrees.
- The magnitude of the disincentive depends on the tax rate, which depends on the type of asset and how much of the return takes the form of a capital gain (rather than, e.g., income).

The locked-in effect disincentivises efficient capital allocation.
- If someone has an asset that has risen in value, there is an incentive to hold onto it rather than sell it and reinvest in a more attractive asset
	- This is because selling twice may incur a higher tax liability than waiting and selling once.
- The tax system includes reliefs specifically intended to mitigate this effect, but those are incomplete.
- **==This is exacerbated further by tax forgiven at death==**. There is an incentive to hold on to assets that have risen in value to bequeath them, even if it would've been more profitable to sell the assets and reinvest them in something else.
	- Or, the stock may have a downward trend, but waiting to pass it on until after death may maximise profit by avoiding tax.

One main problem with CGT is that there are *incomplete loss offsets*, which discourage risk taking.
- Essentially, the government takes a cut when the risk *pays off*, but does not take an equal share in *failure*.
	- This discourages risk-taking, because the payoff associated with a risky payoff skews to be more loss-making.
- This happens because losses cannot be fully offset.
	- When people make a loss, they can offset that against future gains to gain a tax deduction.
		- However, losses often cannot be relieved immediately - while they can be delayed to wait for future gains, the delay reduces the possible deduction.
		- Sometimes, losses can never be offset at all.
	- All else equal, this is arbitrarily discourages risk-taking.
		- This is harmful - we want risky activities to be discouraged by the level of risk, not the level of tax.
# Fixing CGT
There are three possible solutions:
1. ==**Up-front deductions==** - the purchase cost of an asset is tax-deductible at the time of purchase,
2. **==A stream of annual deductions==** - give a stream of annual tax deductions that represent the normal return on the purchase cost,
3. ==**Deductions at the point of sale==** - at the point of sale, step up the initial purchase cost with the interest rate (aka normal rate of return) and deduct that from the final price to calculate the taxable gain.
## Up-front deductions/Cash-flow approach
The up-front cost of an asset is deducted from an individuals income, but then a tax is levied on the *full proceeds*/full value of the asset at the point of sale.
- With a tax rate of 20%, the government bears 20% of the cost of the investment, but gains 20% of the excess returns.
	- The government bears 20% of the cost because if your investment goes down in value, you deducted more from taxes than you pay later when the asset is disposed (assuming income tax is equal to capital gains). However, if the asset goes up in value, they get 20% of that gain.
