# Summary
## UK National Living Wage
### Evidence
- The labour market is not characterised by a perfectly competitive supply and demand framework.
	- Firms have a degree of price setting power.
	- In an imperfectly competitive labour market, a higher minimum wage could reduce vacancies and turnover instead of destroying jobs.
	- Eventually a higher minimum wage will lower employment.
		- Where this point is, is the empirical question.
- In the US, the evidence points toward modest impact on low wage employment of minimum wages.
	- The best evidence suggests that the employment effects are small up to around 60% of the median wage.
	- Evidence using sub-state county-level variation found this to hold even in lower wage counties where the minimum stood up to 81% of the median wage.
	- Research also found that in the 7 US states where minimum wage is the highest, binding for around 17% of the workforce, employment effects are similarly modest.
- Not all US studies suggest small employment effects.
	- The weight of the evidence leans in the other direction, however.
	- Recent research has helped to reconcile some divergent findings.
- Recent UK research on the National Minimum wage does not find substantial negative effect on low wage employment.
	- One study found impacts on part-time female workers,
- Evidence for little impact on low wage employment is also consistent with research on minimum wages in Germany and Hungary.
- ==Small effects on employment suggest firms adjust to higher wages in other ways==
	- There is clear evidence that prices are an important margin of adjustment,
	- There is limited evidence on the impacts of profits and productivity.
### Implementation
- There needs to be a clear mandate for the Low Pay Commission (LPC) to pause and reconsider if new evidence suggests significant job losses following a higher minimum wage.
	- Lowering the NMW is unlikely, so the main revision would likely occur through inflation.
- It is important to improve data infrastructure so that the LPC and academics can evaluate the policy in a timely manner.
# Chapter 4: Evidence on Minimum Wage Research: impact on incomes and employment
- Minimum wages affect too small a percentage of the workforce to use national-level statistics. Therefore, researchers must focus on sub-groups.
	- However, heterogenous effects across different groups, e.g., teens and older low-wage adults, may lead to inappropriate conclusions for all groups affected by minimum wage laws.
Some papers which examine specific groups:
- Neumark and Wascher (1992),
- Card (1992),
- Allegretto et al. (2019)
Some papers which focus on incumbent workers:
- Currie and Fallick (1996),
- Stewart (2004),
- Clements and Wither (2019)
#further-reading
- Focusing on incumbent workers, categorised by pre-intervention wages and then tracked, is that we can apply the results more broadly. However, it is difficult to gauge effects on those entering the workforce following the policy.

Papers which focus on low-wage firms:
- Katz and Krueger (1992),
- Card and Krueger (1994),
- Harasztosi and Lindner (2019),

Papers which focus on a number of low-wage jobs, paying at, or slightly above, minimum wage:
- Cengiz et al. (2019),
- Jardim et al. (2018).
#further-reading 
- Focusing on this section, often called the "bunching" approach, allows an examination on the effects of jobs which bunch around the minimum wage and thus allows us to assess how a minimum wage impacts the total number of generally low-wage jobs.
## Evidence from the US:
- The US has a lot of variation in local minimum wages.
