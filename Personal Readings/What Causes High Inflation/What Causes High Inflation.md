- References.
# Assumptions
1. Firms and workers have sticky normal profits,
2. A firm's marginal cost curve embeds the owner's opportunity cost,
3. Lower profit levels can reduce investor sentiment for a firm,
4. Firms have knowledge about what factor inputs should be in the future,
# Deriving a Model From these Assumptions
1. From A1 and A2, we know normal profit levels must be, at a minimum, equal to the profit levels of the previous period.
2. From A1, A2 and A3, we know that for larger businesses with greater shareholder interest, this fact is even more enforced. Retaining the same level of profit for these shareholders is even more imperative than for firms ran by small businesses.
	1.  This means that businesses will always try to cling onto normal profit levels; rather than shutting-down, they will try to increase price.
	2. If all business owners raise prices to retain normal profit, we see inflation. This causes an increased demand for wages which would increase the marginal cost; workers and firms will start fighting over the wage and price share.
3. Thus, mark-up exists because firms can leverage their position to underpay factor inputs.
## Initial Problems
- In 2.2, it should be clear that if firms can successfully *retain* normal profit, they have not *increased* mark-up, that have just
