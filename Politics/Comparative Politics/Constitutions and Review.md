## What is a constitution?
A constitution is a body of meta-norms that specify how all other norms are meant to be applied, produced, enforced and interpreted. It can:
- Establish government institutions and how those institutions are to interact
- Grant institutions the power to make, apply, interpret and enforce law
	- This could be by enumerating the powers of those institutions
	- This could also be by setting constraints on that institution
- Set out legislative procedure
- Set out how legislative authority is constituted, e.g. via election

### Types of Constitutions:
1. Absolute Constitution
2. Legislative Supremacy Constitution
3. The "Higher Law" Constitution

#### Absolute Constitution:
The dominant meta-norm is: "The Rulers are Above the Law"
- No concept of popular sovereignty
- No seperation of powers
- Centralised and absolute power
e.g., Saudi Arabia

#### Legislative Supremacy Constitution:
The dominant meta-norm is: "A Rule of Legislative Supremacy"
- Constitution is not entreched (thus no special procedures for revision)
- Parliamentary statutes are supreme (no judicial review of statutes)
- No substantive constraint on parliamentary power
This typically provides a stable set of government institutions, and requires legislative elections.
e.g., the U.K., New Zealand

#### "Higher Law" Constitution
- Dominant meta-norm: "Constitutional Rights"
- 'The People' are sovereign (legislative supremacy is explicitly rejected)
- Provides substantive constraints on the exercise of public authority, and provides institutions to enforce such constraints (independent judiciary)
- Constitution is entrenched
Typically provides stable set of government institutions and requires legislative elections.

## Key Terms:
- Entrenchment: Constitution requires a special procedure to be changed. E.g., in the USA you require both Houses of Congress and the amendment must be support by 3/4 of states. (There can be varying degrees of entrenchment)
- New Constitutionalism: A convergence towards the "Higher Law" Constitution. This is characterised by:
	- Institutions deriving authority from a codified constitution
	- Popular sovereignty via elections/referendums
	- Public authority is only lawful insofar as it conforms to the constitution
	- A charter of rights and review mechanism to protect these rights
	- Specified procedure for constitutional review

## Constitutional Review
Different countries conduct reviews and ameliorations of their constitutions in different ways.

In the USA, any judge has review powers. However, the European model is more centralised and only the constitutional court has the power to perform a constitutional review. It is an exclusive court, and seperate from the judiciary and the legislature.
