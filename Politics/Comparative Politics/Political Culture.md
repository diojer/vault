Political Culture is the political psychology of a country, nation or subgroup.
It can be seen as the patterns of orientation towards political objects among members of a nation.

Which values, attitudes, and beliefs must citizens possess to allow democratic institutions to flourish? This is a guiding question when discussing political culture.

**Congruence Thesis**: In order to maintain stability, the institutions of a country should align with the political culture.

## Five Nation Study
(Almond and Verba 1963)

Study of the U.S., U.K., Germany, Italy, Mexico
	Interviews and studies

They found that there were 3 main forms of political culture:
- Parochial
	- Unaware/dimly aware of the political system in all its aspects
- Subject
	- Cognitively oriented primarily to the 'output' side of the government
- Participant
	- Individuals tend to be aware and informed of the political system (government and politics.)

## Revived Modernisation Thesis
(Inglehart and Welzel)

Variation in prevailing values is large, however it can often be boiled down to one dimension of cross-cultural variation.

## Cultural Change
Early research depicted the ideal democratic culture as one in which an 'allegient' type of citizen dominates. 
- In an allegiant democratic culture, citizens participate in 'elite-mandating,' not so much 'elite-preventing'.
- This is supposed to relieve decision makers from public pressures, giving them more energy to focus on solving problems.

Newer research depicts the ideal citizen as 'expressive'.
	- This different type of citizen is more 'elite-preventing'
	- More public pressure is supposed to force decision-makers to conform more to public opinion.

In general, since post-industrialisation, civil society has changed to becoming more expressive rather than allegiant. This change in values also emphasizes freedom of expression and equality under the law.

### Culture is:
------
	- Evolutionary
	- Distinctive
