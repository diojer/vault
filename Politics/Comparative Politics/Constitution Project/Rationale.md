## How does the History of China factor into decisions?
To answer this, we must examine the rise of the Chinese Communist Party and how their interaction with the Republic of China led to their victory in the Chinese Civil War. Furthermore, we should analyse the abuse of martial law and what precautions other states take to ensure that abuses like this do not happen in the future.

## How can we prevent historical abuses of power?
We should examine the military dictatorship in Taiwan, which happened even though retained the same constitution as the Republic of China - what were the misaligned incentives which allowed for the dominance of one political party: the Kuomintang? Why is it that it was necessary to wait for one individual to democratise the country?
We should look into how the United States deals with declarations of martial law. 
- Civilians retain the right to be tried by civilian courts, unless these are dysfunctional
- The President is never allowed to take control of National Guard units without the consent of state governers
- It is not possible to declare martial law without Congressional approval
- The president cannot declare martial law, only individual state governers
	- In this way, the power to declare martial law is not formulated within the constitution, but instead in the constitution of each state of the United States of America.

## How do the various institutions fit together?
The Republic of China constitution gives us a good framework to create and link various institutions. These are the five branches of Government, known as the 5 Yuans:
- Legislative
- Executive
- Judicial
- Control
- Examination
The rules dictating how each institution interacts with one another are specified in the Constitution, and more simply, on Wikipedia.
#### What are the united goals of each institution?
This is subject to change - however I think that our main aims will be to facilitate the connection between the public and public policy, without allowing change to be made to quickly, as this will allow change to be undone very quickly. Consequently, amendments to the constitution must not be too easy to pass.

## How does the Constitution establish the relation between public, and public policy?
This will most likely be left up to the legislative branch and how they are elected, as well as how the executive branch is created.

## How do your political institutions affect the way the public think about politics?
Having some sort of referendum system for new constitutional amendments could be good for increasing public confidence in the political system. Too many elections is likely to cause voter fatigue and lead to a loss in turn-out, making our system less representative.
