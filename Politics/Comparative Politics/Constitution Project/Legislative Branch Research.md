## Voting people into power


## Number of Representatives
### Context and Precedent
China is a very large country, and there must be steps taken to ensure that regional, as well as democratic, interests are protected in legislative proceedings. Some areas of China are extremely populous, so it is important that these do not dominate over others.
### Lower House
### Upper House
- Should be limited to two representatives
	- This ensures the upper-house (which can be termed The Senate) is kept small and discussion is easier
	- Prioritising small size is a goal of most senates in federalist states, such as Russia and the USA; these countries both only have 2 senators per region/oblast.

## Ratification of Constitutional Amendments
### Context and Precedent
### Process

## Tricameral body? Comittee of unelected experts commenting on legislation?
### Context and Precedent
The main precedent for this house is inspired by the House of Lords. An expert comittee scrutinising bills can be seen as a good thing. On the other hand, vesting too much power in the hands of unelected individuals is often seen as a stray away from democracy and towards a more technocratic society. Furthermore, the nomination procedure for these individuals could place too much power in people who have an interest not to appoint the most qualified experts, but instead those who will ease the passing of bills.
### Rights and Constraints
### Pros and Cons
- **Pros**
	- Even if no power to stop bills is vested within this body, they still have the power to introduce bills
