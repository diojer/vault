# Key Questions
1. What are the workings and effects of colonialism?
	- The main effect is the establishment of 'whiteness' as the norm, whereas 'blackness' is cast as inferior.
	- As a result, black people feel dehumanised and inferior, so they attempt to dissociate themselves from 'blackness' and don 'white masks'.
	- Thus, restoring dignity to black people must be a political question.
1. How can/should colonialism be resisted, what is the role of violence?
	- Since colonial oppression is total, decolonisation must be absolute.
	- The violence of the colonised mirrors the violence of colonialism,
		- Violence is seen as a way for the subject to restore a sense of identity,
	- However, Fanon is far from praising violence - he is aware of the dangers of endless cycles of violence.
1. How can common pitfalls be avoided?
	- National independence is not enough,
	- Authoritarianism, limiting of democracy, growing economic inequalities, rise in racist discourse, etc. are all common pitfalls,
	- To avoid this, we need social and political transformation and spaces for people's democratic engagement.
