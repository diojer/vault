# Lecture One
First, Foucault talks about "a series of researches".
The researches have failed to develop into any continuous or coherent whole. They are fragmentary and can't be said to have proven anything. These are:
- The history of penal procedure,
- Evolution and institutionalisation of psychiatry in the 19th century,
- Some observations on sophistry, Greek money and the Inquisition,
- A history of sexuality,

One of Foucault's first points is that totalitarian theories, i.e., theories which attempt to think in terms of a totality, have been a hindrance to research.

On the other hand, the recent 10-20 years has been a period characterised by "dispersed and discontinuous offensives" - these offensives have been localised and efficacious. This isn't to say the criticisms are naïve, nor that they are "self-imposed ascetism". Instead, this character of criticism indicates an "autonomous, non-centralised kind of theoretical production, one that is to say whose validity is not dependent on the approval of the established régimes of thought."
Another feature of these local criticisms is that they have been proceeded by a "return of knowledge" - what Foucault calls an "insurrection of subjugated knowledges." By this he means two things - on the one hand, they are historical contents which were hitherto hidden by functionalist or systemising thought; on the other hand, they are knowledges that were disqualified as inadequate, naïve, e.g., that of the psychiatric patient, of the ill person, etc.
It is through the reappearance of these knowledges "that criticism performs its work."

Foucault notes that there seems to be a paradox in grouping specific, exact, erudite historical knowledge with disqualified and local knowledge. However, their commonality is that both retain the memory of hostile encounters which are often confined to the margins. Foucault terms the union of erudite knowledge and local memories *genealogy*.
Genealogical research is concerned with analysing the claims of genealogy against the claims of a unitary body of theory which often filters genealogy in the name of "true" knowledge. Therefore, Foucault says genealogies are "precisely anti-sciences", not a more careful or exact form of science.
Foucault is concerned with the insurrection of knowledges that are opposed primarily to the centralising powers which are linked to the institution and functioning of organised scientific discourse, not denying the contents, concepts or methods.
- **Question**: one of the centralising powers in modern scientific discipline could be seen as the institution of prestigious scientific journals. However, this seems to be denying some key *methods*, such as peer review and general dissemination. With those two methods of the scientific process, how would scientific journals not necessarily exist?
As an example, Foucault references Marxism - many people have argued about whether Marxism is a science or not. However, for these scientific socialists, Foucault poses the following questions:
- What types of knowledge to you want to disqualify?
- Which subjects of experience and knowledge do you want to diminish?
- Which theoretical-political *avant-garde* do you want to enthrone?
Foucault sees the establishment of a science not as a vindication of rationality, but as a process of exclusion and power-attribution.

Conversely, genealogy seeks to "emancipate historical knowledges … it is based on a reactivation of local knowledges … in opposition to scientific hierarchisation". Archaeology is the appropriate methodology, and genealogy is the tactics whereby the subjected knowledges "were thus released and brought into play".

Foucault says that modern the modern scientific hierarchy seems to be ready to adopt the genealogies it once rejected. The genealogist's task, however, is not to try and unite the disparate genealogies, instead, it is to expose and specify the issues at stake in the insurrection of knowledges against the institutions.

However, a question remains - how does the scientific hierarchy exert its power all around society? To simplify, Foucault poses the question: "is the analysis of power or of powers to be deduced in one way or another from the economy?" He says he is not trying to abstract all the different points in which centralised institutions exert their power into a single point, however he believes that the juridical and Marxist conceptions of power do all share a common point.
- **Question**: why is the juridical and Marxists conception of political power relevant to how the various differing genealogies are suppressed?
	- **Answer**: because centralised institutions exercise and are imbued with power which they use to suppress genealogies.
Juridical power:
	Power is taken to be a right, it can be possessed or transferred like a commodity. The partial/total cessation of natural, human power enables political power to be established. Thus, the constitution of political power obeys the model of a legal transaction.
Marxist power:
	Very different from juridical, takes the economic functionality of power to be important. Power is conceived primarily in terms of the role it plays in the maintenance of the relations of production. Thus, the reason political power exists at all is found in the economy.
Thus, both conceptions of power see it as being subordinate to the existence of an economy.

Foucault wants to conduct a non-economic analysis of power.
- **Question**: Why? Do we need this analysis to free genealogy?
On the one hand, power can be seen as "that which represses" - this is a very common definition.
On the other hand, couldn't we analyse it in terms of struggle, conflict and war? In this case, political power is unspoken warfare, the role of which is to "re-inscribe \[this relation] in social institutions, in economic inequalities, in language..."
- **Question**: is "this relation" conflict? What exactly is the relation Foucault thinks political power is reinscribing?
This is his non-economic analysis of power. The two definitions are reconcilable, according to Foucault.
- **Question**: in what way are these non-economic? Surely these could just be descriptors for a commodity? Seems like Foucault has said "houses are described economically - as things to be bought and sold, or as assets which ensure the wealth of the middle class. But I seek to conduct a non-economic analysis of houses: they are areas people live in, often with multiple rooms". It takes away from the economic aspect, but it isn't detaching the thing itself from its relationship from the economy. This also raises the question - were the juridical and Marxist descriptions even analyses of power itself, or were they simply analyses of the consequences/functionality of power?
Foucault now contrasts contract-power with war-power. Where oppression was a consequence of a transgression of a contract in contract-power, in war-power, repression is simply an effect and continuation of what power is.
- **Question**: isn't this equivocating? Repression and oppression are two different things. Contract-power theorists might accept that people are being repressed, but oppression only occurs when the terms of the contract are transgressed.

To finish off his first lecture, Foucault says that these two conceptions of power must be considerably modified and subject to closer scrutiny. Those researches he mentioned at the beginning all involve power, however the power is of completely different character to contract-power or war-power theories.
# Lecture Two
In this lecture, Foucault will submit his own theory of power which differs from the two we have covered, war-power and contract-power.
To recap, power produces truths through centralised institutions which in turn reproduce this power. Power itself is limited through the rules of right.
Foucault explicates some precautions we should take:
1. We shouldn't think of power in terms of one person dominating another, but in terms of "multiple forms of subjugation that have a place and function within the social organism".
2. We shouldn't focus on intentions, but effects,
3. Power isn't homogenous or individualistic, it is discontinuous and circulates,
4. The individual is the effect of power, rather than its starting or end point,
5. We should genealogically investigate how mechanisms of power have been able to function
"We must eschew the model of Leviathan in the study of power. We must escape from the limited field of juridical sovereignty and State institutions, and instead base our analysis of power on the study of techniques and tactics of domination".
This techniques and tactics are important - in bourgeois society, there has developed *disciplinary power*, which is radically different from sovereign power. Despite this, sovereign power remains the dominant way of thinking of power.

Disciplinary power involves normalisation to coerce people into compliance. Some key points:
- It typically involves monitoring and surveillance,
- It changes across institutions,
- It doesn't just repress, it also produces subjects and identities,
- It is dispersed.
