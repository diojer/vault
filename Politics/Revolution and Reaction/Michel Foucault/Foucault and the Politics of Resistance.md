# Introduction
Some people view Foucault's analysis of power as paralyzing, because it is viewed as so all-encompassing. This suggests that he slows, rather than promotes, resistance. Furthermore, [[Nancy Fraser Foucault on modern power.pdf|some critics]] argue that since Foucault provides no normative reasons why resistance is preferable to submission, he cannot explain why anyone should resist.
Pickett states that analysis of Foucault's ideas on resistance tend to be "mere codicils to lengthy examinations of power".
# Foucaultian Resistance
Pickett traces Foucault's [[Agonism|agonism]] from the early 1960s to the final decade of his life.
Pickett creates three periods with which to analyse Foucaultian Resistance:
- First: *Madness and Civilisation*
- Second: Renewed sympathy for Marxism, likely spurred by 1968
- Third: *Discipline and Punish* ~1975

Pickett then responds to the question of whether Foucault's work leads to paralysis, rather than resistance (especially considering he lacks a normative stance). He settles on the response that Foucault places no limits on resistance, since any limits will be derived from ideals supported by modern power. Therefore, Foucaultian resistance becomes trapped between restrictions of modern power and celebrating abhorrent forms of engagement - Foucault chooses the latter.
## First Period: *Madness and Civilisation*
In his first period, Foucault had not yet formulated power as a central problem. Resistance was against *limits*.
Foucault is concerned with the foundational issues of a culture. These foundational issues are *categories*, which he sees as dichotomies, providing the context for social belief and action, such as good/evil and normal/pathological. His prime example is reason/unreason.
Foucault proposes that these limits work by silencing some voices and amplifying others. He states that the writings of Nietzsche, Van Gogh and Artaud are able to amplify the "shrieks and frenzy" of silenced voices (p.231) Transgression of the limit to recognise what it excludes, hence "the world is forced to question itself" and "is made aware of its guilt." (p.231)

Foucault's aim is not a world without limits, instead he has two different things he wants to achieve. First, he wants to criticise "that other form of madness, by which men, in an act of sovereign reason, confine their neighbors" (p.ix) i.e., he wants to recognise the experiences and speech of excluded/marginalised populations. Second, he wants to revive [[Agonism]] in culture: reason has silenced madness, whereas he thinks the conflict is healthy.

Foucault argues that although transgression is the (temporary) negation of a limit, it is not itself negative, since it "affirms limited being" (*Language, Counter-Memory, Practice*, p.35) Various limits placed upon us, often seen as natural, solidify an identity for those who help place them. Transgression allows us to undermine limits, but new ones always arise. Thus, transgression is a permanent agonistic stance. Foucault explains this in *The Thought from Outside* (1966):
"Anyone who attempts to oppose the law in order to found a new order, to organise a second police force, to institute a new state, will only encounter the silent and infinitely accommodating welcome of the law." (p.38)

So Foucault says that the purpose of transgression is not to construct a new, better system (this is self-defeating), instead it is just to undermine limits.
## Second Period: Revolutionary Action
Foucault moves on from his "archaeological" period and is more concerned with institutional practices, e.g., in prisons, factories schools, etc., and the ideological constructs that support these practices. Primary among these constructs is humanism.
## Humanism
What Foucault means by this changes through-out his work, but it generally refers to various conceptions of what human beings are. Foucault follows Nietzsche in thinking that human nature is the expression of history and social practice. Thus, any theory of what a person ought to be like, by nature, is false, and constrains human possibilities, marginalising those who fall outside of this "nature".

A prominent aspect Foucault attacks is references to a "normal" individual based on scientific discourses of psychiatry or criminology - by legitimising what is done in prisons and asylums, categories of humanism "dispel the shock of daily occurrences" (*Language, Counter-Memory, Practice* p.220). Humanism also legitimises liberal democracy:
"In short, humanism is everything in Western civilisation that restricts *the desire for power*: it prohibits the desire for power and excludes the possibility of power being seized". (ibid, p.221-222)

Thus, returning to the first period, the undermining of the limits of humanism is necessary. Foucault claims that one of the most effective ways of doing this is to learn how those repressed by institutions were "divided, distributed, selected, and excluded in the name of psychiatry and \[...] in the name of humanism" (ibid p.229)
This insurrection reveals previously hidden techniques of power - can be referenced from [[Two Lectures - Notes]] or from *Language, Counter-Memory, Practice*

In the early 1970s, Foucault repeatedly emphasises that one does not struggle against power to achieve justice; rather, one struggles to take power. (*Human Nature*, p.182 or *Language, Counter-Memory, Culture* p.208). In this war for power, the idea of an individual fixed within a series of hierarchies is overthrown.

Another example of struggle against humanism is the new intellectual - someone who learns from the masses (those most exposed to power), rather than someone who tries to impose *on* the masses. Theory becomes merely one more tool in the struggle against power. Foucault also says a universal theory is dangerous - "I think to imagine another system is to extend our participation in the present system" (ibid, p.230).
Instead of opposing the ideal to the real, Foucault suggests opposing the real to the real. Once a transgression has been made and certain "intolerables" are revealed, a struggle has been created. Thus, the central task is to attack categories which invalidate the knowledge or experience of the marginalised.
