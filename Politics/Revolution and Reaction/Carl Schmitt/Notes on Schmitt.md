# Parliament
Two contradictory parts of parliamentarianism:
- Democracy,
- Liberalism,

His ultimate conclusion is that in the Weimar Republic, one of three things will happen:
- The liberal side of things will have to assert itself and suppress the democratic elements,
- The democratic elements will suppress liberalism,
- Some third "myth" will have to come along and destroy them both.
## Constitution
- Reichstag drafts laws,
- President can introduce emergency laws under Article 48,
	- Times of emergency are not made explicitly clear,
- The President appoints the head of the Reichstag,
- The constitution has a Bill of Rights,
- The President is elected once every 7 years,
- The Reichstag used proportional representation to elect members,
### Problems with the Constitution
- No authority/tradition,
- Very pluralistic,
- Inflation and national humiliation inflamed extremist political feelings,
- Political parties were able to organise their own paramilitary groups,
## Schmitt's Questions for Liberal Democracies
- How can stability be achieved?
- What is the relationship between Law and Politics?
- What is the role of parliamentarianism in all of this?
### Democratic part of Parliament
- What is democracy?
	- Schmitt claims, up until recently, democracy was just an opposition to what there was at the time, i.e., monarchism.
	- Social contract is a people recognising itself as a people,
	- There are no divisions between people *as people*.
	- The people's will = general will = law.
	- Thus, democracy is a basis for legitimacy.
### Liberal part of Parliament
- What justifies a Parliament?
	- It is expedient, (but so is dictatorship)
	- Schmitt says that the essence of parliament is about argumentation and deliberation. These things do not necessarily take democracy into account.
	- So, the liberal conception of Parliament rests on openness and division of powers.
	- So, law is *reason* and not *command*.
### Conclusion
Schmitt says, the crisis of parliamentarianism can be allied for a time, but as soon as it achieves power, liberal democracy must decide between its elements.
