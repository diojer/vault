- Revolutions are important because they say something about what is distinctive/important about politics.
- If there is one unifying feature of Arendt's work, its the attempt to distil what is distinctive about *politics* as a sphere of human interaction.
	- Difficulty arises because, in her view, a lot of the things we call political are, in her view, not political - she has a narrower view of politics.

Arendt's political thought is, to some extent, organised around a series of distinctions. In each case, she favours the latter.
1. Social and Political,
	- The Social Question concerns a form of society oriented towards administration, gathering, and solving. The French Revolution and Marxism are, therefore, grounded in the social rather than political.
	- Arendt was notoriously anti-feminist, because she didn't like activities based on the interests of specific groups.
	- She felt that the modern bureaucratic state compounded the social aspect of human lives.
	- The above are different answers to the Social Question. To be distinctively political, something must have public discussion and expression. For Arendt, politics is a type of activity which occurs when humans collectively participate, gather in a public space and talk about issues. All social issues, on the other hand, involve the outsourcing of political activity to someone else; meanwhile, politics necessarily involves participating individuals.
2. Necessity and Novelty,
	- When something is necessary it means that there is no choice about picking it.
	- What makes us distinctively human is our capacity for novelty. Politics provides a space for novelty/creativity to come to fruition.
3. Liberation and Freedom,
	- Liberation refers to, at most, being rendered free from necessity. Liberation is a necessary precondition for freedom.
	- Freedom, though, 
4. French and American Revolutions,
	- She disliked the historically deterministic view of the French and Russian Revolutions. 
	- Beef with Hegel: Classic example of a philosopher who only cared about the purity of the concept. She cared more about practical situations.
		- Dislikes this greatly, doesn't think it counts as political activity.
	- Liked the American Revolution and Jeffersonian Democracy - believed that the local participation reflected political activity.
		- They started with minimalist aims and it grew organically.
		- "Fetishised the American Revolution"
			- Poetic license on the historical events?
	- All three cases did, at one point, have periods of true political fervour. However, it did eventually dissipate, the difference is the speed and to what degree.
5. Political Parties and Councils.
	- Political parties don't really encourage novel debate.
	- Councils are institutions where citizens can physically get together and engage in political activity.
