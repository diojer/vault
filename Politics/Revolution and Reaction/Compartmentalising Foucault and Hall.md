# Power
## Foucault
- Three different kinds of power
	- War
	- Contract
	- Discipline
- Power gives the ability to produce truth, creating dichotomies and deciding which are valid/invalid sources of knowledge
## Hall
- Hegemonic culture holds power
- There exists struggle on numerous fronts in society, however none are reducible to each other.
## Similarities
- The dominant power isn't that which can defeat contestation, it is that which is *uncontested*.
- Similarities which Hall gives
- Dominating power gives others the language to speak
- Both seem to agree that class still plays a major role in power, viz. Hall on any of his examples or viz. Foucault on Humanism
