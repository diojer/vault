Sedlmayr begins by explaining power as used by Luhmann, who says that power "functions as a communication medium" (L).
Importantly, because every communicative process implies contingency/risk on both sides, means there is a "possibility of rejecting the selections on offer transmitted by the communication." (L) However, the function of power lies in the regulation of contingency.

Moving onto Hall, he dismisses the idea that cultural studies "emerged fully grown from the head" (H) and instead asserts that it is "necessary to do some genealogical and archaeological work on the archive" (H), referencing *Foucault*. Any attempt at finding a "pure" origin, "a moment without history, yet a moment at which history begins" (S) fails because the language we use "inevitably carries in itself traces of history, tainting the alleged purity" (S). So, we have to talk about "emergence" which is the word Foucault used for it (this bit is dumb).

In society there are different apparatuses of control, e.g., the police, judiciary and media, and Hall (in *Policing the Crisis*) wonders if the concept of a "societal control culture" explains how they cohere to systematically regulate "deviancy". This approach is valuable, Hall argues, because it asks the question of who has the power to label whom and reflects on the skewed distribution of power between law-makers and breakers. **On the other hand, it is not sufficient - it doesn't locate centres of power *historically*, so it cannot designate significant moments of shift and change.**

Hall prefers the term *hegemony* rather than power. This shows his link to the Marxist Gramscian movement and his opposition to orthodox Marxist canon. He also disagreed with economism, or the view that ideology is reducible to the economic structure of society. Most of this discussion is found in [[Culture, Resistance and Struggle]].

In *Policing the Crisis* coercion and the production of consent are explicitly characterised as two complementary types of power (H p. 200) exercised by the capitalist state. A capitalist state only resorts to coercion in times of crisis, but "functions best when it operate\[s] normally through leadership and consent" (H p.200). When this is the case, there is stable hegemony. Thus, to achieve hegemony requires some level of sacrifice from the hegemon and a compromise equilibrium. However, economic sacrifices are not enough, Hall states that "the conditions for capitalist production and the reproduction of its social relations must be articulated through *all* levels of the social formation - economic, political, ideological."

However, Hall empahasises that such compromise does not mean that true equality has been achieved.

Hall says that ideology has "to do with the concepts and the languages of practical thought which stabilise a particular form of power and domination."
Consequently, power and hegemony are closely intertwined: "hegemony refers to the kind of power which permeates a whole society ... in order to stabilise a specific hierarchical ensemble by serving the interconnected interests of particular dominant groups in a temporally and spatially contingent situation" (S)

As people in society became better and better-off, the compatibility equilibrium became more disturbed, which finally culminated in the 1970s with the "mugging panic", one of the paper's main focuses, standing out as a symptom. When there is a crisis, the invisibility of hegemonic power fades, and to counter this "unmasking" (H, p. 214), the dominant group attempts to cure the cause of the rupture - one of the main ways of doing so is by leaning away from consent-production and towards coercion.

Ideology formation within dominant classes is varied, unlike what orthodox Marxism would seem to imply.

Thatcherism is another of Hall's examples. He says that the "discursive relations of power" cannot be constituted exclusively on the terrain of the state, instead, they necessarily crisscross the social body.

2. Power is not reducible to the state, it is dispersed throughout society,
3. Power is diffuse and dispersed and can never be located "for good"
4. Power produces truth
	1. Very similar to Foucault, obviously, can reference his book *The West and the Rest: Discourse and Power* where he explicitly uses Foucault's definition of power.

Hall also brings up the fact that the creation of knowledge of a particular group can affect that group.
