# Introduction and Summary
Essay focuses on resistance, opposition and struggle.
Cultural struggle is not reducible to other areas of determination.
While culture is still influenced by other social aspects and its "conditions of existence", it is not reducible to them.
# Consequences of Marxist Theory
Hall identifies two consequences with merging a Marxist theory with a non-economic/class reductionist approach.
First - "the relationship between particular elements within the ideological terrain as sites of struggle and their relationship to class formations" p.181
Second - "The relation among the different contradictions that structure the social formation" p.181

# Class Irreducibility
First example Hall gives of irreducibility: the question of rights. Rights are crucial to the formation of bourgeois ideology. However, the language of rights is not exclusive only to the bourgeoisie. While the demand for rights may be contained in reach by societal conditions, but they are nevertheless effective movements of protest, resistance and struggle.
While the language of rights existed prior to capitalism, the formation of capitalism gave it a new set of meaning.
The dialectical formation of a class emerges when a class' new language formation emerges from a series of adjacent connotations. However, it doesn't follow that all elements of this new language belong exclusively to that class. For example, the adoption of the "democratic" label by socialists.
The use of bourgeois language by socialists does, however, stitch it to the current liberal framework and contain the more radical elements. Going back to democracy, this manifests in pushing for individual, rather than collective, power.
Hall says that it's important to understand that fully implementing liberal ideas, which the bourgeois is actually opposed to, would be beneficial for many people. It is wrong to think that just because an idea is bourgeois in origin it cannot be used in struggle - the idea is too reductionist regarding the relationship between ideology and class. p.184
## The Primacy of Class
Hall does not think there is any hierarchy between different contradictions in society, class being one of them. He also thinks it is necessary to acknowledge the irreducibility of one to the other.
The solution is to see that different struggles take the leading position on a range of different fronts p.185
This attitude is necessary to bring Marxism into contemporary society, rather than "create illusory scenarios which cheer us up".
Hall also brings up the example of apartheid South Africa being very race-based, and while race and class are often tied together, they are irreducible to one another.
# Cultural Resistance
This can have many different forms and effects.
- Cultures of survival
	- Certain groups may require this to not be completely overwhelmed by alternative definitions of their culture and history (?)
	- Such cultures neither guarantee nor necessarily generate the basis of a culture of hegemony. Groups can survive without the slightest chance of being in the leading position.
	- Forms of culture that arise in response to the need for survival are not necessarily strong enough to negotiate with hegemonic formations (?)
		- The ability to survive is certainly one of the conditions of possibility for such negotiation.
		- Negotiation sounds "reformist" according to Hall, but he notes that it is extremely important to have such capabilities to win any ground at all, even in radically changing situations. p.188
	- Example (finally):
		- Period after Chartism, where British labour lost its capacity to define the world in its own image.
		- In its decline, it turned inwards and developed its own culture and warrant (reason for being?)
		- It negotiated spaces and found ways of "keeping people off its terrain"
		- It developed important institutions and penetrated into the lives of labourers
		- This culture can still be felt today.
The strengths and contributions of culture are always contradictory. For example, with the British labour movement, the same culture which allowed differentiation from the bourgeois also enforced masculine centrality and was "in some ways blind to the contradictions of gender". p.188
## Domination and Resistance
Hall says we should think of these as processes. The forms of resistance by different groups provide the space for intervention. We should recognise the strengths and weaknesses of these forms and work on them rather than expecting people to adopt completely new forms.
The latter strategy just serves to alienate people and falsely implies that your form of culture is more ideologically pure.
Cultural politics and ideological struggle are not sufficient in themselves to restructure social formation (p.189), they are necessary.
# Determining Culture
Hall expresses reservations that culture can fit so neatly into Williams' (1977) categories of dominant, residual, and emergent - cultures rarely have their identities inscribed on their surface (p.190) and change rapidly - what might be avant-garde in one year is subsumed into dominant in the next.
The dominant culture not only has its own language, but it also gives other culture the possibility of speaking - this relates back to Liberal culture and the language of rights.
"Hegemony entails precisely this capacity to continually command a central position within an apparently open plurality of voices".
When power is exerted and other voices are suppressed, hegemony has not yet been secured.
Hall gives the example of Mods and Rockers - their culture was "shadowed" by class, because while not strictly or solely determined by it, it was still very influential.
## Secondary Contradictions
In his work at the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies, Hall focused more on locating youth subcultures within their specific class framework, framing their other qualities as "secondary contradictions", which he feels was wrong. He probably did not give the proper weightings to the effects of different contradictions.
However, he still thinks the work is important for linking class and other considerations, while not claiming they are wholly irreducible to class.
## "Cultural Forms alone will not Guarantee"
(p.194)
Hall suggests that there is no guarantee of the progressive or regressive nature of cultural forms.
He draws on the Skinhead subculture as an example. This culture amplified proletarian symbols and was articulated against the middle class. The institutions surrounding proletarian culture, such as football clubs, provided effective channels to direct youths into fascistic political positions upheld by the National Front.
Thus, what seemed like an inherent progressivism in Rock music was exposed.
Rock against Racism is an interventionist group that attempted to explicitly link popular forms of culture to political affiliation. Hall says that, in general, political movements instead often just hope they have correctly guessed an emerging culture's progressivity.
To feed into Hall's more general point, cultural forms are important, but require social and political practice to articulate them to particular political positions.
Cultural resistance which fails to take into account the intricacies of the cultural form is not likely to create "alternative subjectivities", but resistance concerned *only* with forms, as if that guarantees political content, is likely to disappoint.
# Operating within a Dominant Culture
Hall suggests that negotiation and finding spaces within a dominant culture is important for resistance. This is reminiscent of [[#Domination and Resistance]]. As an example, he uses slaves in the West Indies and the UK who had to find ways to operate outside of the dominant culture. For example, black people in Jamaica often drum miles out from town, or, while singing hymns, often have interesting ways of preserving their cultural roots within the singing.
He argues that slaves adopted the dominant culture in a way that is adaptive, in a way that "something is secured, some advance is made, maintained, and continued".
Hall talks about the development of Ska music, and how it demonstrated a desire to detach Jamaican culture from colonisers and adopt a unique identity. He argues that one central aspect of all nationalist movements is to constitute a new subjectivity (read: experience): the Jamaican identity. The differences apparent in newly freed Jamaica called into question who really owned the country, as there was a wide variety of different races. Hall argues, then, that unity had to be created so that identity did not divide the country so harshly. Ska is one of the ways to do this.
Hall also suggests that Rastafarianism is a way of operating within a dominant culture: it comes from various oppressed groups reading their own struggles into the Bible, the only book they had at the time. 
	"It had the capacity to construct new subjectivities because it operated in the religious field in a society in which religion is an absolutely central bearer of meaings".
## Positives and Negatives
While religion was important in creating a culture of survival and new subjectivities in Jamaica, Hall also claims it contributes to the nation's anticommunism. 
# Politics
Hall says, there are no Jamaican people. There are many people and they can be constituted in many different ways.
When different cultural forms become organically associated with certain political movements, such as Manley and Rastafarianism in Jamaica, politics becomes endowed with "very special -- almost instrinsic -- cultural attributes".
# Stereotypes
Hall says that there are many jobs, in the UK for example, that have clear racial connotations. However, although the class position is important, it is through the "categories and structures of race that they become conscious of the complexities of the systems of exploitation of which they are the object." (p.203)
Hall says that young black people are in almost all respects worse of than their parents who immigrated to the UK, however they are better off in one respect - they have a proper sense of self. For example, Hall's young black Britons spoke a deeper patois than their ancestors.
	This would not, Hall claims, be possible without music or religion. There are limits imposed by these religious origins, however without those origins it would not exist at all. 
# Resistance
Resistance is "the continual practice of working on the cultural domain and opening up cultural possibilities" (p.206)
The conditions within which people are able to construct new subjective possibilities are won, not given, says Hall. They are won in the practice of articulation which produce them.
