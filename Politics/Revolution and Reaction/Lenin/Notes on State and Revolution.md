# Chapter 1: Class Society and the State
## Part 1 - The State: A Product of the Irreconcilability of Class Antagonisms

Lenin begins by asserting that one of Marx's main messages, the need for a violent upheaval of present society, has been distorted by Social Democrats - such as Kautsky - and capitalists wishing to "iconise" him. The mainstream Marxism of Lenin's time has robbed Marx's theory of its substance, so he claims.
After "blunting" Marx's theory, the Social Democrats - many of whom still call themselves Marxists - argue against revolution, and instead talk about how they may use the modern state to their advantage. This is the main focus of Lenin's criticisms.

Lenin starts by asserting that any state can only exist due to class antagonisms - the modern state only exists because of class conflict between the capitalist and working class. He starts by referencing Engels, who says that the state exists because without it, class antagonisms would consume society; with state power, this conflict is alleviated and society is kept in order. Lenin extends this to its natural conclusion, and states that, "the existence of the state proves that class differences are irreconcilable".
## Part 2 - Special Bodies of Armed Men, Prisons, etc.

Lenin uses Engels to posit a definition of the state. It involves some kind of power, namely "special bodies of armed men having prisons, etc., at their command" and places itself above society, meaning that this special body is distinct from the "general population organising itself as an armed force". It also divides its subjects according to territory.

Lenin says that it is necessary for this special body to separate itself from society, because if it didn't, "self-acting armies" of each class would lead to an armed struggle between them.
## Part 3 - The State: An Instrument for the Exploitation of the Oppressed Class

Exploitation comes in the form of:
1. Taxation of the exploited classes,
2. Elevation of the police to a higher level than the oppressed class,
3. Special laws are enacted proclaiming the immunity of public officials.

In a democratic republic, Engels (and consequently Lenin) claims that wealth exercises its powers indirectly, but all the more surely. First, by the direct corruption of officials, and second, by and alliance between the government and the stock exchange.
As an example of this corruption, Lenin points to a kind of "rotating door" between cabinet officials and "capitalists" - what kind of industry Palchinsky joined is not mentioned.

## Part 4 - The "Withering Away" of the State

Lenin's main point in this part focuses on the distortion of Marx and Engels by Social-Democrats and "opportunists" and "philistines".

The withering away of the state is concerned with the higher phase of communist society, which follows the lower phase and the dictatorship of the proletariat, which follows some kind of violent revolution.

Most mainstream Marxists and anarchists, in Lenin's time, used the notion of the "withering away of the state" to advocate against revolution. 

Lenin outlines some main necessities for a communist society:
- Violent revolution,
- Take possession of the means of production in the name of society,
- The state must be replaced by the dictatorship of the proletariat, which suppresses the bourgeoisie in the name of the proletariat.

The suppression of the bourgeois state by the proletarian state is impossible without a revolution, but the abolition of the proletarian state is possible only through the process of withering away.
# Chapter 5: The Economic Basis of the Withering Away of the State
## Part 1 - Presentation of the Question by Marx
In *Critique of the Gotha Program*, Marx outlines the connection between the state and Communism.

Lenin begins by observing that of the two, Marx is often seen as more "statist", whereas Engels believes  mention of the state should stop altogether. However, he says this is wrong.
## Part 2 - The Transition from Capitalism to Communism
Lenin expands upon Marx's historical argument from *Critique*, which mainly argues that immediately following a Communist revolution, there exists a period of transformation known as the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Lenin explains the relationship of this dictatorship to democracy. 
First, he discredits capitalist democracy, saying we are confined by narrow limits. Furthermore, he says because people are so "crushed" they don't even care about democracy. Thus, capitalist democracy remains democracy for an insignificant minority. He also disagrees with liberal thinkers that this democracy will evolve into a "greater and greater democracy" because of the numerous small obstacles put in front of workers voting.
He says that democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat will be the first true democracy, because the vast majority of people are workers, not capitalists. Engels says the primary interest of the dictatorship will not be freedom, but holding down adversaries. As soon as it becomes possible to speak of freedom, i.e., as soon as capitalist forces are crushed, "the state as such ceases to exist". Thus, Lenin advocates the exclusion of all capitalists and exploiters from proletarian democracy.

To clarify, Lenin says that in capitalism, the state is a special machine in order for the minority class to suppress the majority class. Because suppression is still necessary in the transition period, the state is not immediately destroyed. As time progresses, the need for a special machine to suppress capitalists is no longer necessary, because they are simply a minority.
The proletarian state also provides a foundation to coordinate production and distribution, and re-educates people out of a capitalist mindset.
