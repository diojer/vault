Beauvoir was most associated with the school of Existentialism.
- Existentialist ethics
	- No external moral order, morality is grounded in lived experience,
	- No predetermined purpose, purpose is defined through experience
	- Opposed to any school of philosophy which tries to impose an all-encompassing theory
- "He is the Subject, he is the Absolute, she is the Other"
	- To be a man, there are two key features:
		1. To have agency,
		2. The perspective of 'maleness' is in some ways seen as neutral/universal.
			- Womanhood is seen as specific/biased
			- Beauvoir gives an example: in an argument, women can be accused to be biased because they are a woman, but men's ideas are rarely impugned simply for being men.
	- These dynamics whereby masculinity is seen as neutral and femininity is associated with 'otherness' are recurrent themes in many areas of human experience.
- "Every time transcendence falls back into immanence, stagnation, there is a degradation of existence into the '*en-soi*'"
	- Transcendence - rising above, 'other-worldliness'
	- Immanence - to stay within, 'worldliness'
		- Mothers sometimes encourage daughters to fit within easier, but less free, areas of society,
		- Women's lives are focused - more than men's - on domestic labour and childcare.
			- You could make a case that childcare and domestic labour involves some sort of transcendence, but Beauvoir describes it as immanent because many women experience it as something inevitable, unavoidable, intrinsic.
			- Some ambiguity - women's lives are marked by a reduced scope for agency, but she's an existentialist; existentialist philosophy posits that even in any given situation you always have the freedom to do what you want. So, she could be accused of looking down on women who choose to do domestic labour/childcare.
	- She claims that to be a man is to be afforded opportunities for transcendence.
	- To be subject to norms of femininity is to be subject to constraints.
- "One is not born a woman, rather, one becomes one"
