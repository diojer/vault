Two approaches to forming the argument:
1. Illustrate both theories and move onto a practical example to illustrate it,
2. Start with a practical example and move to theoretical arguments to make sense of it.

Current main argument:
- Butler - deontological, focuses on actions themselves and how they imply different levels of grievability.
	- 

- Fanon - consequentialist, focuses on psychological implications of violence and the tragedy of colonial resistance.


Butler
- Self defence:
	- 
- Instrumental violence:
	- -

Fanon
- Equality not yet held, equal standards not applied.

Butler and Fanon both criticise an instrumental approach to violence, mainly by pointing to how the end state which is often considered does not fully capture the total result of violence. However, Butler and Fanon diverge when considering violence as a whole: while Butler finds that any theoretical defence of violence posits an unequal distribution of grievability, Fanon argues that resistance must first begin with an acknowledgement of existing inequality which means that separate groups, the colonised and coloniser, cannot be held to the same standards.

Practical example: ???? Algerian National Liberation Front???
