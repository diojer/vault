Seminar Notes:
- Sartre downplays the effects of violence: it is simply necessary
	- Doesn't account for the fact that a violent revolution is not simply one-sided - the oppressed revolutionaries will inevitably face violence.
	- Sartre doesn't fully convey the origins of the trauma felt by the revolutionary native.
		- "Hardly has the second generation opened their eyes than they have seen their fathers being flogged".
			- Discounts effects of war, only examines the build-up to justify the war itself.
		- "In psychiatric terms, they are 'traumatized' for life".
	- Does Sartre ironically see Fanon as a tool?
		- "France is finished... unless" $\to$ unless the colonies listen and understand Fanon?
- Fanon is acutely aware of the psychological impacts of war because he has to study it as a part of his job.
	- Subject B whose wife and daughter were raped, or subject S who was traumatised by the firing squad.
