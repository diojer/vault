Two main points:
1. There is an equivocation between the potential and actual when it comes to grief. Just because not everyone is, in actuality, *grieved*, does not preclude anyone from being griev*able*,
2. There isn't a proper acknowledgement of decisions in which there are trade-offs. When one group/individual is prioritised over another group B, that doesn't mean that B isn't valued, just that the former may be prioritised.
