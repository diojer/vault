Two main points:
1. There is an equivocation between the potential and actual when it comes to grief. Just because not everyone is, in actuality, *grieved*, does not preclude anyone from being griev*able*,
2. There isn't a proper acknowledgement of decisions in which there are trade-offs. When one group/individual is prioritised over another group B, that doesn't mean that B isn't valued, just that the former may be prioritised.

"If we object to the suffering under colonialism, even decry it, without calling for a basic transformation of the structures of colonialism, then our objection remains at that register of moral principle that can attend only to the deleterious effects of political systems without attempting a broader social transformation of those conditions that generate those effects. This does not mean that we have to retract our objections to suffering, but only that we must exchange that form of humanism for an inquiry that asks: What has happened to the very notion of the human under such conditions?"
- This is a good point, basically saying:
	- If we object to outcomes under a certain system, without calling for a structural transformation of that system, then we are existing only at a naïve, "first-pass" moral state without considering how to properly change the system that produces those outcomes.
		- We don't have to abandon all features of humanism, instead we just have to ask what was the humanism that we claimed to hold, considering it resulted in such a 'bastardised' version of the human?


"What is remarkable about Fanon’s view, perhaps put more strongly than Sartre is willing to replicate, is that the body itself becomes historical precisely through an embodiment of social conditions."
- Seems to disprove Ewara's entire argument tbh.


"It seems clear that violence drops out of the picture when we imagine a community defined as an infinite unity of mutual needs."
- p.226

"At the moment I do violence to an Other—one who oppresses me or who represents that oppression or who is complicitous with that oppression—I make room not only for my own self-invention but for a new notion of the human that will not be based on racial or colonial oppression and violence."
- Butler's description of Fanon

"Over and against the view that there can be no self-creation without violence, Fanon here exemplifies the philosophical truth that there can be no invention of oneself without the “you” and that the “self” is constituted precisely in a mode of address that avows its constitutive sociality."
- Butler here using the word "philosophical truth" clearly implies she agrees with the statement.
