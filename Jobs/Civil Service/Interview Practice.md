# Behaviours

	- Seeing the bigger picture
	- Delivering at pace

	- Communicating and Influencing
- Sometimes you may be asked to do a presentation
- Behaviours are things you do regularly and well
- Two kinds of behaviour questions:
	- Past Experience
		- Similar to old "competency styles", e.g., "tell me about a time where..."
		- STAR approach is recommended
		- Remember to give "lessons learned"
	- Situational
		- "Imagine you're in this situation, what would you do?"
		- Don't bring up past examples
		- Example:
			- You've been given an urgent deadline for the end of the day - how do you prioritise your work?
