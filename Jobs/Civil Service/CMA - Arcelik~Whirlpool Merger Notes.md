# Summary
- Arcelik is attempting to acquire Whirlpool's EMEA Major Domestic Appliances business.
- The transaction gives rise to a realistic prospect of a **substantial lessening of competition** (SLC) because of **horizontal unilateral effects in the supply of washing machines, tumble dryers, dishwashers and cooking appliances**.
- Arcelik is planning to open a new standalone business, Beko Europe. Whirlpool will own 25% of the shares in exchange for the target business, Whirlpool's EMEA division (Europe, Middle East and Africa).
- CMA have found a realistic prospect of SLC.
	- The CMA enforced an undertaking in lieu by the 5th of Oct. If no such undertaking is offered, the CMA will refer the Transaction pursuant to section X of the Enterprise Act 2002 (sections 33(1) and 34ZA(2) )
# Who are the businesses?
- Arcelik is a Turkish company that supplies home appliances.
	- In the UK they supply primarily under the Beko, Blomberg and Grundig brands.
- Whirlpool is a US company that manufactures and markets globally a full line of domestic appliances and related products. In particular, major domestic appliances (MDA) and small domestic appliances.
- The product markets the CMA investigated were washing machines, tumble dryers, dishwashers, refrigerators, freezers and cooking appliances.
# Why did the CMA review?
- The CMA's duty is to promote competition for the benefit of consumers.
- A turnover test has been met given that the Target generated more than Â£70mn in the UK in the most recent financial year.
- The transaction is conditional on receiving merger control clearance from the CMA.
# What evidence has the CMA looked at?
- Internal documents and other market participants.
# What does the evidence say about...
## The effects on competition?
- The CMA found that the transaction raises significant competition concerns:
	- The merged entity would be the largest individual supplier in each category of washing machines, tumble dryers, dishwashers, and cooking appliances.
	- The evidence indicates that the parties compete closely with each other, particularly on low- to mid-range prices,
	- The parties will face some competition from alternative suppliers (European, Chinese and Private label brands) but this constraint is unlikely to be sufficient to prevent a significant reduction in competition in these product categories.
		- To be specific, most of these competitors compete less closely with the parties than the parties do with each other.
- There are not significant concerns for the price of refrigerators and freezers.
	- They have comparatively lower market shares,
	- Face considerable outside competition,
- The parties claim that customers are sophisticated, have a high degree of buying power, and can switch easily between major domestic appliance (MDA) suppliers. However, the CMA found that the transaction would reduce the number of alternative suppliers.
## Entry and expansion?
- The CMA has not received evidence to indicate that any entry or expansion in response to the transaction would be timely, likely, and sufficient to prevent the SLCs from arising.
# What next
- The parties must submit an undertaking in lieu. If they do not, a phase 2 investigation will begin.
# Counterfactual
- No parties put forward that the typical analysis of the CMA should be specially changed.
	- Whirlpool has made submissions stating that its position in the market has been declining over recent years.
	- Whirlpool would likely end/slow down its EMEA MDA business.
	- The CMA asked whether Whirlpool would end its MDA business if the transaction did not go through - the Board confirmed that yes, its EMEA section would either be divested or ended.
- The CMA believes that Whirlpool would instead have pursued a different strategy absent the transaction. The CMA notes that Whirlpool's senior management recognised that "all options" were under consideration.
	- The CMA considers that there is considerable uncertainty.
On this basis, the CMA considers the prevailing conditions of competition to be the appropriate counterfactual.
# Competitive Assessment
## Horizontal Unilateral Effects
- The most common type of theory of harm that can give rise to competition concerns in mergers.
- Happens when one firm merges with another that previously provided a competitive constraint.
	- Merged entity can raise prices or degrade non-price aspects (e.g. quality) without need to coordinate with rivals.
- More likely when parties are close competitors, but can occur without this.
- The CMA analyses the prospects of horizontal unilateral effects in each of the six frames of reference.
	- The CMA's assessment of the competitive effects of the merger does not need to be based on a highly specific description of a particular market.
	- However, the assessment of the relevant markets is still an important tool which can allow proper evaluation of the effects of the merger (this allows queries with third-party competitors, analyses of counterfactuals, and analyses of consumer behaviour).
## Washing Machines
Combined, the Merged Entity would control 30-40% of the washing machine supply.
The parties have a strong market position.

Closeness of competition:
- Suppliers which are active across materially different price points are less likely to be close competitors.
- In washing machines, the parties have the **highest share in the bottom two price quartiles, with a combined share of 40-50% in the first and 60-70% in the second**. The parties earlier state that do not think it is appropriate to separate products into price categories because it is believed other competitors can quickly enter into low-price competition.
	- There are only Private label suppliers and Haier competing in these quartiles.
- The CMA recognises that there is no standard price segmentation and that there is still a competitive constraint emanating from other price segments. Nonetheless, the CMA considers that pricing analysis is informative as to the relative strength of the parties and their competitors' product focus by price.

Internal documents
- The parties do benchmark their products against each other, but claim that they also regularly benchmark and reposition themselves against other competitors.
