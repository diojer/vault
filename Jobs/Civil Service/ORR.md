"What motivates you?"
- Three things:
	- I have to use rail services very often
	- I personally enjoy policy research and merging multiple different subject areas into one
	- I have recently started working on transport research and although it's quite new to me I find reading through existing papers very interesting and I'd like to take it a step farther.
		- This does differ from the ORR, I imagine the ORR takes on a more regulatory role than a planning role, but the whole world of transport is really interesting to me now.
Stakeholders
- Network rail
- Train operators
What does ORR/the policy team do?
- Tries not to be prescriptive, but action is taken when performance problems are not addressed.
- I recently read your April newsletter, so I'm familiar with the recent recommendation for a £5 cap. I also saw your analysis of 
	- I'm really into this kind of stuff - it sounds nerdy, but I really like this kind of policy prescription combined with prior data crunching.
	- Control Period 7
# Behaviours
- Behaviours being assessed:
	- Communicating and Influencing
		- Influencing: presenting the benefits of going with your approach
			- Situational question
				- "Imagine you're working on a project - you want to take it in a certain direction but stakeholders don't agree. How would you influence them positively to go in your direction?"
					- Key is to use evidence, but also to assess what the underlying values are.
					- Adapt approach where there are a few people that don't agree - try to have a 1-to-1 conversation.
					- Be open to receiving feedback
					- Show that you're not stubborn and not a team player
			- Past Example question
				- "Tell me about a time when you've had to adapt your communication style to address your audience"
					- Think of a time you really took into account your end customer
	- Delivering at pace
		- Situational Q
			- "Imagine you've been given an urgent deadline that is non-negotiable, needed for the end of today. You have other projects that need to be finished by the end of the week. How would you approach?"
				- The main priority is the work that has been given to me most recently. I would get started with this, but also evaluate my other tasks to see which I can reasonably move down the priority list. If I feel like the extra work will impact my ability to finish all of my weekly tasks by their deadline, I would keep in contact and warn my team so they know and could support me if need be. 
					- Could I delegate this task?
					- Let stakeholders know
						- Be firm in approach
					- Start the work and be as efficient as possible
						- Give progress updates
					- Get someone to read over work as QA
				- **DSWQ - Delegate, Stakeholders, Work, Quality-Assurance**
		- Past Example Q
			- "Tell me about a time where you had to work to a strict deadline and ensured quality standards remained high?"
				- Quality doesn't suffer as a consequence
				- What have you learned?
	- Working Together
		- Situational Q:
			- "Imagine you've been asked to lead a project/piece of work with a colleague from another team. You both disagree on the approach to take. How would you handle this situation."
				- Have a conversation with the person who disagrees
				- Present data and evidence
				- Focus on the common goal
				- It's important to resolve differences to keep the team together
		- Past Example Q
			- "Tell me about a time when you were successful in getting people to work together?"
				- **Remember: Preparation and Delivery for ACTION**
					- **Tangible, Personal and Transferable RESULTS**
# Strengths
- Possible questions:
	- Communicating and influencing
		- "Are you effective at communicating?"
		- Say yes - talk about times where you've been commended/received good feedback
		- Think about projects where you've worked with others
		- Process:
			- Adapt approach to different audiences
				- Important to meet people where they're at
				- Show you're respectful of views and take needs into account
			- Use evidence
			- For influencing: focus on shared values: it's important to share a foundational understanding in order to influence people at all. So, locate shared values and focus on those.
	- Working together
		- Reference examples and what you brought to the team
			- I am typically the team leader and I'm typically placed in that position because my knowledge base but also because I am the first one to actually get the ball rolling with a group project. For example, I'll usually be the first one that does any extensive research on the topic we've been assigned. On the other hand, when the team works well together and others also do research, I think my ability to synthesise different approaches and influence others is what allows me to retain position as leader.
				- Examples: Urban Planning and Transport, Fuel Poverty Essay
		- Process:
			- Focus on common goal
			- Focus on shared values
			- Resentment cannot be allowed to build-up, so give concessions when needed - no one wants to feel completely unheard
	- Delivering at pace
		- "Do you enjoy working to a deadline?"
			- Yes - I enjoy keeping to a deadline, my current roles see me working with constantly shifting deadlines and I have become very good at prioritising tasks throughout my different projects and keeping in communication, ensuring that if I have been given too tight a deadline in light of some other, more important, newer task, no-one is ever surprised by a rescheduling.
			- "In the past, I've had to work to deadlines doing..."
				- Briefly touch rather than giving full STAR examples
		- Process:
			- Delegate
			- Talk to stakeholders
			- Work efficiently
			- Assure quality
- Strengths to be assessed will not be shared ahead of the interview

# Back-up
- What does it mean to be a good project manager?
	- A few things:
		- First, get a good pulse on the group. You really have to understand everyone's strengths, motivations and interests.
		- Second, you have to have a solid vision for the project. Whenever I've been the leader in a group, 
- What does it mean to collaborate creatively?
	- For me, creativity is the ability to synthesise existing research and facts into a new solution to fit your exact situation.
- What does it mean to work independently?
	- Working independently, for me, involves impeccable time balance, working at pace, but also keeping in constant communication with others - even while the work is independent, I think it's important to update people on the status.
- What is effective communication?
	- I think effective communication boils down to two things:
		- SIMPLIFICATION and DECOMPOSITION.
		- Inter, and intra-team comms
		- Inside of the team, emotional intelligence and authenticity is required, a more casual tone is ok.
		- Between teams, supervisors, stakeholders, etc., the most important thing is ensuring that only what needs to be said is said. With stakeholders or supervisors, simplicity is important.
		- On the other hand, when bringing orders into the team from outside, I should be able to 
- "Discuss a recent problem you faced and how you found the best solution."
- "How would you use various computer applications to deliver work efficiently and effectively?"
